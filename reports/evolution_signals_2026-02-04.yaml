  - signal_id: "sig_2026020401"
    signal_type: "scope_escape"
    timestamp: "2026-02-04T00:00:00Z"
    rule_id: null
    context: |
      Multi-agent concurrency requires state machine modifications 
      that touch kernel layer - currently no formal concurrency model exists.
      Tension: A2 - State machine concurrent semantics undefined
    severity: "high"
    suggested_evolution: |
      Formalize concurrency model in state_machine.yaml with explicit 
      locking semantics and conflict resolution strategies.
    status: "new"
    
  - signal_id: "sig_2026020402"
    signal_type: "threshold_tension"
    timestamp: "2026-02-04T00:00:00Z"
    rule_id: null
    context: |
      Evolution feedback loop minimum cycle is ~37 days (7d aggregation + 
      30d measurement). Too slow for rapid iteration quantitative research.
      Tension: C3 - Feedback loop latency too long
    severity: "high"
    suggested_evolution: |
      Introduce parallel A/B testing track with shorter feedback windows 
      for lower-risk evolutions (see AEP-6).
    status: "new"

  - signal_id: "sig_2026020403"
    signal_type: "missing_skill"
    timestamp: "2026-02-04T00:00:00Z"
    rule_id: null
    context: |
      No mechanism to transfer agent trust across projects. Each project 
      requires rebuilding trust from Level 0, blocking institutional deployment.
      Tension: B1 - Human approval bottleneck not scalable
    severity: "high"
    suggested_evolution: |
      Introduce Organization Layer with trust transfer mechanism 
      (see AEP-7).

  - signal_id: "sig_2026020404"
    signal_type: "rule_friction"
    timestamp: "2026-02-04T00:00:00Z"
    rule_id: "R2"
    context: |
      Rule R2 (one task at a time) expressed in natural language cannot be 
      parameterized for multi-agent scenarios or conditional exceptions.
      Tension: E1 - Rule expressiveness is non-compositional
    severity: "medium"
    suggested_evolution: |
      Introduce Rule Expression Language (REL) for structured rule 
      definition with parameters and conditions (see AEP-8).
    status: "new"

  - signal_id: "sig_2026020405"
    signal_type: "ambiguous_guidance"
    timestamp: "2026-02-04T00:00:00Z"
    rule_id: null
    context: |
      Evolution effectiveness measurement relies on friction signals,
      but evolution can reduce friction signal collection rate (blind spots).
      No mechanism to distinguish "real improvement" from "expanded blind spots".
      Tension: C1 - Self-referential measurement problem
    severity: "medium"
    suggested_evolution: |
      Introduce meta-evolution monitoring with blind spot detection 
      (see AEP-6 blind_spot_detection section).
    status: "new"

  - signal_id: "sig_2026020406"
    signal_type: "tooling_gap"
    timestamp: "2026-02-04T00:00:00Z"
    rule_id: null
    context: |
      No tooling to validate cross-project dependencies at runtime.
      R9 requires declaration in lineage.yaml but verification is 
      only at experiment start, not during long-running experiments.
      Tension: A3 - Cross-project reference verification timing
    severity: "medium"
    suggested_evolution: |
      Implement continuous checksum validation for external references
      with configurable polling interval.
    status: "new"

  - signal_id: "sig_2026020407"
    signal_type: "threshold_tension"
    timestamp: "2026-02-04T00:00:00Z"
    rule_id: null
    context: |
      Gate thresholds (e.g., OOS Sharpe >= 1.5) are static, but quantitative 
      research may need context-dependent thresholds (market regime, risk level).
      Tension: D1 - Gate system is static
    severity: "low"
    suggested_evolution: |
      Extend threshold schema to support conditional values based on 
      experiment context (see AEP-8 conditional thresholds section).
    status: "new"

  - signal_id: "sig_2026020408"
    signal_type: "ambiguous_guidance"
    timestamp: "2026-02-04T00:00:00Z"
    rule_id: null
    context: |
      Rule priority system (P4 > P3 > P2 > P1) is static with no runtime 
      adjustment mechanism. Hotfix scenarios may need temporary priority shifts.
      Tension: C2 - Rule priority is static
    severity: "low"
    suggested_evolution: |
      Introduce priority modifier mechanism with audit trail 
      (see AEP-8 priority_modifiers section).
    status: "new"
