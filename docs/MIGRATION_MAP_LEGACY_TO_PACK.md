# Migration Map — Legacy → Architecture Pack

This map records how legacy artifacts relate to the canonical architecture pack. Legacy items remain **historical / non-canonical** unless explicitly adopted.

| Legacy Artifact | Canonical Artifact(s) | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AI_WORKFLOW_OS_BLUEPRINT_V2.md | ARCH_BLUEPRINT_MASTER.mmd, ARCHITECTURE_PACK_INDEX.md | superseded | Canonical blueprint is now split into pack artifacts. |
| AI_WORKFLOW_OS_ARTIFACT_MASTER_PLAN.md | ARCHITECTURE_PACK_INDEX.md | superseded | Replaced by pack index. |
| GOVERNANCE_DERIVATION_PLAN_V1.md | SPEC_GOVERNANCE_MODEL.mmd | superseded | Governance spec now canonical. |
| OPERATING_CANON_V2.md | SPEC_GOVERNANCE_MODEL.mmd, TASK_STATE_MACHINE.mmd | partial | Concepts referenced; no direct adoption without review. |
| DRS — Execution First Anchor.txt | PROJECT_DELIVERY_PIPELINE.mmd | partial | Execution anchors inform pipeline design. |
| Execution Playbook — Governance Verification Loop.md | SPEC_GOVERNANCE_MODEL.mmd | partial | Governance loop patterns referenced. |
| Execution Playbook — Task Verification Loop.md | TASK_STATE_MACHINE.mmd | partial | Task loop patterns referenced. |
| Execution Lessons 001.md | ARCHITECTURE_PACK_INDEX.md | inherited (reference) | Lessons inform ongoing updates. |
| Execution Trial 001.md | ARCHITECTURE_PACK_INDEX.md | inherited (reference) | Trial notes retained for audit. |
| 3 ROADMAP_V2.txt | ARCHITECTURE_PACK_INDEX.md | superseded | Roadmap consolidated into pack index. |
| AI Workflow OS — ROADMAP_V2.md | ARCHITECTURE_PACK_INDEX.md | superseded | Roadmap consolidated into pack index. |
| Acceptance Record — OPERATING_CANON_V2.txt | BLUEPRINT_FREEZE_RECORD.md | partial | Acceptance record retained; freeze record is canonical. |
