# Execution Trial 001 — Verification-Only Dry Run

## 0. Record Status & Boundary

- Artifact Type: Execution Evidence
- Governance Authority: None
- Binding Power: None
- State Effect: None

This document records a **single execution trial** conducted solely to observe whether execution and verification mechanisms can operate **without producing authority, state mutation, or governance effects**.

This document:
- Is not a success report
- Is not a failure report
- Does not justify acceptance or progression
- Does not define lessons or best practices

---

## 1. Trial Intent (Non-Authoritative)

The intent of this execution trial is limited to:

- Exercising the Governance Verification Loop
- Exercising the Task Verification Loop
- Observing whether execution remains non-authoritative
- Observing whether verification remains non-progressive

No domain task or application objective is involved.

---

## 2. Governing Artifacts in Effect

At the time of execution, the following artifacts were treated as authoritative constraints:

- AI_WORKFLOW_OS_BLUEPRINT_V2.md
- OPERATING_CANON_V2.md
- GOVERNANCE_DERIVATION_PLAN_V1.md
- DRS_EXECUTION_FIRST_ANCHOR.md
- EXEC_GOVERNANCE_VERIFICATION_LOOP.md
- EXEC_TASK_VERIFICATION_LOOP.md

No other artifacts were treated as binding.

---

## 3. Execution Context (Factual)

- Execution Type: Verification-only dry run
- Execution Scope: Non-domain, non-application
- Execution Backend: Not specified (backend-agnostic)
- Role Mode: Executor Mode
- Authorization Record: Assumed valid for execution; not evaluated here

No governance actions were performed.

---

## 4. Executed Actions (Observed)

The following actions were observed during execution:

- Generation of a trivial, non-domain execution output
- Invocation of Governance Verification reference
- Invocation of Task Verification reference
- Manual inspection of verification dimensions

No artifacts were accepted, frozen, or superseded.

---

## 5. Verification Observations

### 5.1 Governance Verification Observations
- No authority was claimed or implied
- No acceptance or freeze was inferred
- No Role Mode boundary was crossed
- No implicit state transition was observed
- No workflow progression was inferred

### 5.2 Task Verification Observations
- Task definition was intentionally minimal
- Output conformed to the declared trivial task
- No undeclared side effects were observed
- Verification produced no status or eligibility

---

## 6. Authority & State Assessment

- No authoritative artifacts were produced
- No system state mutation occurred
- No governance effect was generated
- All outputs remained speculative

---

## 7. Deviations & Anomalies

- None observed

Absence of anomalies does **not** imply correctness, readiness, or maturity.

---

## 8. Record Closure

This execution trial demonstrates only that:

- Execution can occur without leaking authority
- Verification can occur without producing progression
- Evidence can be recorded without governance impact

No further conclusions are drawn.
