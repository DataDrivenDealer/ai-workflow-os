## 1. Scope & Interpretation Rules

This Roadmap:
- Records what has already occurred
- Records what has been explicitly unlocked
- Does not imply obligation or recommendation

Entries are **historical and descriptive**, not prescriptive.

---

## 2. Recorded Phases (Chronological)

### Phase A — Governance Closure

**Status**: Completed

The following governance artifacts were completed and frozen:

- AI_WORKFLOW_OS_BLUEPRINT_V2.md  
- OPERATING_CANON_V2.md  
- GOVERNANCE_DERIVATION_PLAN_V1.md  

This phase closed the constitutional and institutional governance layers.

---

### Phase B — Execution Entry Authorization

**Status**: Completed

The following planning artifact was established:

- DRS_EXECUTION_FIRST_ANCHOR.md  

This artifact defined the first permitted execution anchor without authorizing application-level execution.

---

### Phase C — Verification Capability Establishment

**Status**: Completed

The following execution capability playbooks were authored:

- EXEC_GOVERNANCE_VERIFICATION_LOOP.md  
- EXEC_TASK_VERIFICATION_LOOP.md  

These playbooks provide non-authoritative verification references and do not produce governance effects.

---

### Phase D — Execution Evidence & Learning

**Status**: Completed (Initial)

The following execution-layer records were created:

- EXECUTION_TRIAL_001.md  
- EXECUTION_LESSONS_001.md  

These artifacts record evidence and non-binding observations without conferring authority.

---

## 3. Current System Position

As of this Roadmap version:

- Governance layers are closed and frozen
- Execution is permitted only within verification-only scope
- No application project execution has been authorized
- No roadmap-driven planning or strategy exists

---

## 4. Explicit Non-Commitments

This Roadmap does **not** commit to:

- Any future execution phase
- Any application project (including DGSF)
- Any timeline or milestone
- Any expansion of execution scope

Absence of commitment is intentional.

---

## 5. Replaceability & Supersession

- This Roadmap may be superseded by later versions
- Supersession records additional history; it does not revise this record
- Persistence of this document does not imply continued relevance

---

## 6. Closure Statement

This Roadmap exists to **mark where the system has been**, not where it will go.

History is recorded.
Authority is not inferred.
