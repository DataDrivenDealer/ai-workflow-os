**Derived From**: AI_WORKFLOW_OS_BLUEPRINT_V2
**Derivation Control**: GOVERNANCE_DERIVATION_PLAN_V1
**Status**: FREEZE

---

## Chapter 0 — Canon Purpose, Scope & Boundary Declaration

---

### **Rule 0.1 — Institutional Purpose of the Operating Canon**

The Operating Canon **exists solely to restate and institutionalize, at the operating level, governance constraints that are already explicitly defined in the active Blueprint**.

The Operating Canon defines **what constitutes legitimate system operation**, not how execution is performed.

The Operating Canon **does not introduce** new authority, new governance semantics, or new decision criteria beyond those explicitly established by the Blueprint.

---

### **Rule 0.2 — Scope of Applicability**

The Operating Canon applies **exclusively** to the evaluation of operating-level legitimacy, validity, and authority eligibility within AI Workflow OS.

This applicability:

* Constrains how system operation is evaluated
* Constrains how execution outputs are judged for eligibility
* Constrains how continuity and operating state are assessed

This applicability **does not** constitute a definition, classification, or expansion of actors, systems, or roles.

Any use of the Operating Canon outside this evaluative scope is invalid.

---

### **Rule 0.3 — Non-Authority Clause**

The Operating Canon **does not possess constitutional authority**.

The Operating Canon **shall not override, reinterpret, modify, or dilute** any constraint defined in the active Blueprint.

In the event of any conflict, ambiguity, or perceived inconsistency, **the Blueprint prevails without appeal**.

The Operating Canon **shall not be cited** as justification for deviation from Blueprint-defined constraints.

---

### **Rule 0.4 — Non-Interpretation Clause**

The Operating Canon **shall not be used as an interpretive instrument**.

The Operating Canon **shall not**:

* Resolve Blueprint ambiguity
* Infer unstated intent
* Harmonize Blueprint tensions
* Provide rationale, explanation, or motivation

Where interpretation is required, **interpretive authority rests exclusively with the Project Owner** and cannot be inferred from this Canon.

---

### **Rule 0.5 — Non-Extension Clause**

The Operating Canon **shall not extend governance scope**.

The Operating Canon **shall not** introduce:

* New governance objectives
* New decision criteria
* Execution preferences
* Convenience-driven allowances

Any governance extension requires **explicit Blueprint-level change** and is invalid at the Canon layer.

---

### **Rule 0.6 — Institutional Restatement Constraint**

Every rule contained in the Operating Canon **must be directly restatable as an institutional consequence of an explicit Blueprint statement**.

Rules that cannot be traced to an explicit Blueprint clause are invalid and must not be included.

The absence of a rule in this Canon **shall not be interpreted** as permission, allowance, or deferral.

---

### **Rule 0.7 — Binding Nature of the Operating Canon**

Once accepted and frozen, the Operating Canon is **binding at the Canon layer**.

All Protocols, Specifications, Templates, and operational artifacts:

* **Must conform** to this Canon
* **Must not weaken, reinterpret, or bypass** its rules
* **Must inherit** its prohibitions without dilution

Violation of this Canon constitutes a governance violation.

* Blueprint V2 §15 — Canonical Authority of This Document

**Derivation Statement:**

* No new governance semantics introduced
* No interpretive resolution performed
* No procedural or execution logic added

---

## Chapter 1 — Canon Position & Inter-Canon Boundary (Frozen Early)

---

### **Rule 1.1 — Canonical Position in the Governance Stack**

The Operating Canon is situated at the **Canon layer** of the AI Workflow OS governance stack, **strictly below the active Blueprint and strictly above all Protocols, Specifications, Templates, and operational artifacts**.

This position is **derived from the Blueprint and fixed by governance structure**, not defined or alterable by this Canon.

---

### **Rule 1.2 — One-Way Dependency Constraint**

The Operating Canon **derives exclusively and unidirectionally from the active Blueprint**.

No Protocol, Specification, Template, operational artifact, execution output, or established practice **may constrain, modify, reinterpret, or back-propagate authority into** the Operating Canon.

Any form of reverse dependency, circular dependency, or lateral derivation at the Canon layer is invalid.

---

### **Rule 1.3 — Inter-Canon Non-Overlap Principle**

The Operating Canon **shall not overlap in scope, responsibility, or semantic authority** with any other Canon.

In particular, the Operating Canon **shall not redefine, duplicate, or reinterpret** governance responsibilities assigned to other Canons, including but not limited to:

* AUTHORITY_CANON
* ROLE_MODE_CANON
* STATE_CANON
* AUDIT_CANON

Each Canon governs an **exclusive institutional domain**.
Overlap, redundancy, or semantic encroachment between Canons constitutes a governance violation.

---

### **Rule 1.4 — Canon-Specific Scope Restriction**

The Operating Canon **defines only operating-level institutional constraints**.

Accordingly, the Operating Canon **shall not**:

* Define constitutional authority
* Define role identities, role semantics, or permissions
* Define system state composition beyond operating-level constraints
* Define audit procedures, processes, or evaluative criteria

Any matter reserved to another Canon is **out of scope** and invalid within this document.

---

### **Rule 1.5 — Canon Supremacy over Lower Governance Layers**

Once accepted and frozen, the Operating Canon **takes precedence over all Protocols, Specifications, Templates, and operational artifacts**.

All lower-layer artifacts:

* **Must conform** to this Canon
* **Must not weaken, reinterpret, or bypass** its constraints
* **Must inherit** its prohibitions without dilution

Any lower-layer artifact conflicting with this Canon is invalid.

---

### **Rule 1.6 — Blueprint Supremacy over the Operating Canon**

The active Blueprint **supersedes the Operating Canon without exception**.

In the event of any conflict, ambiguity, or apparent inconsistency between this Canon and the Blueprint:

* The Blueprint prevails automatically
* The conflicting Canon rule is invalid to the extent of the conflict

The Operating Canon **shall not** be used to constrain, reinterpret, or override the Blueprint.

---

### **Rule 1.7 — Prohibition of Implicit Priority or Ordering**

The sequence, placement, or grouping of rules within the Operating Canon **shall not be interpreted as priority, workflow order, dependency, or procedural guidance**.

This Canon **does not define internal conflict resolution or precedence rules**.

Any precedence or conflict resolution authority exists **only where explicitly defined by the Blueprint**.

---

### **Rule 1.8 — Stability of Canon Boundaries**

Once the Operating Canon is accepted and frozen:

* Its position in the governance stack is fixed
* Its inter-Canon boundaries are fixed
* Its scope restrictions are fixed

Any modification to Canon boundaries requires **explicit Blueprint-level change** and is invalid at the Canon layer.

---

## Chapter 2 — Operating-Level Governance Invariants (Restated)

---

### **Rule 2.1 — Artifact Supremacy Invariant (Operating Level)**

Within AI Workflow OS, **all operating-level evaluation of system legitimacy, validity, and authority eligibility shall be grounded exclusively in externalized artifacts**.

Conversation history, transient context, execution-side memory, model state, or inferred understanding **shall not be recognized as authoritative or system-relevant state**.

Any operating evaluation not grounded in artifacts is invalid.

---

### **Rule 2.2 — Governance–Execution Separation Invariant (Operating Level)**

Governance and execution **shall remain structurally and institutionally separated at all times**.

Execution **shall not** define governance constraints, commit system state, grant authority, or perform self-validation.

Any operating behavior that collapses or blurs the boundary between governance and execution is invalid.

---

### **Rule 2.3 — Explicitness and No-Implicit-State Invariant (Operating Level)**

All operating-level system-relevant state **must be explicitly externalized as artifacts**.

Implicit assumptions, inferred completion, unstated decisions, or execution-side memory **shall not be recognized as system state**.

If an operating state cannot be reconstructed exclusively from artifacts, it is invalid.

---

### **Rule 2.4 — Explicit Transition Requirement (Operating Level)**

All operating-level state transitions **must be explicit, observable, and artifact-backed**.

Implicit progression, assumed acceptance, inferred completion, or silent state mutation is prohibited.

Any operating outcome relying on implicit transition is invalid.

---

### **Rule 2.5 — Speculative Execution Invariant (Operating Level)**

All execution conducted within AI Workflow OS **is speculative by default**.

Execution outputs **do not** create authority and **do not** mutate system state.

No execution outcome becomes authoritative without explicit governance action recorded as acceptance and freeze.

---

### **Rule 2.6 — Authority Non-Speculation Invariant (Operating Level)**

Authority **shall never be speculative, provisional, probabilistic, or emergent**.

At the operating level, authority exists only as the result of explicit governance actions recorded as authoritative artifacts.

Any operating behavior treating authority as gradual, inferred, or execution-derived is invalid.

---

### **Rule 2.7 — Prohibition of Implicit Coordination Effects (Operating Level)**

Operating-level behavior **shall not rely on implicit coordination, hidden consensus, or unrecorded collective effects** to produce governance impact.

Any governance-relevant effect must arise solely through explicit artifacts and explicit governance actions.

Operating patterns producing governance effect through implicit coordination are invalid.

---

### **Rule 2.8 — Invariant Non-Negotiability Rule**

The operating-level invariants restated in this chapter **are non-negotiable**.

No Protocol, Specification, Template, execution practice, optimization, or convenience consideration **may weaken, bypass, conditionally apply, or override** these invariants.

Violation of any invariant constitutes a governance violation.

## 三、OPERATING_CANON_V2

## Chapter 3 —— **最终修订版（Final / Freeze-Ready）**

> 下文为 **合议团一致通过文本**，可直接进入 Acceptance / Freeze。

---

# OPERATING_CANON_V2

## Chapter 3 — Workflow Spine as Institutional Invariant (Not a Process)

---

### **Rule 3.1 — Canonical Workflow Spine Declaration**

AI Workflow OS enforces a single canonical **Workflow Spine** as an institutional invariant:

**Intent → Decision → Artifact → Execution → Validation → State Update**

This spine defines the **only legitimate structural form** by which work may progress within the system.

Any work that cannot be mapped to this spine is invalid.

---

### **Rule 3.2 — Prohibition of Procedural Interpretation**

The Workflow Spine **shall not be interpreted or applied as a process, procedure, workflow, or execution sequence**.

The Workflow Spine **shall not**:

* Prescribe operational steps
* Imply execution order or timing
* Provide optimization, efficiency, or best-practice guidance

Its sole function is to constrain **structural legitimacy**, not to guide execution.

---

### **Rule 3.3 — Mode-Aware Legitimacy Binding**

Legitimacy of any action associated with the Workflow Spine **shall be evaluated exclusively relative to the active, authorized Role Mode** under which the action is performed.

No stage of the Workflow Spine may be entered, progressed, or evaluated without a valid Role Mode.

Actions performed outside a valid Role Mode are invalid regardless of outcome quality.

---

### **Rule 3.4 — Prohibition of Implicit Stage Progression**

Progression between positions within the Workflow Spine **must not be implicit**.

Completion, acceptance, validation, or state update **shall not be inferred** from execution behavior, artifact existence, or elapsed time.

Any operating behavior relying on implicit progression is invalid.

---

### **Rule 3.5 — Prohibition of Execution–Validation Collapse**

Execution and validation **shall not be collapsed into a single action or effect**.

Execution **shall not** produce validation effect.
Validation **shall not** be inferred from execution success.

Any operating behavior that merges execution and validation effect is invalid.

---

### **Rule 3.6 — Exclusive Authority of State Update**

State Update is the **only position** within the Workflow Spine that mutates authoritative system state.

State Update occurs **only** through explicit governance actions, including acceptance, freeze, or supersession.

Execution or validation activities **shall not** mutate system state.

---

### **Rule 3.7 — Institutional Legitimacy of Rejection and Discard**

Rejection and discard are **institutionally legitimate outcomes** within the Workflow Spine.

Discarded execution outputs:

* Do not constitute failure
* Do not require justification
* Produce no authoritative effect

Preservation of legitimacy and authority clarity **takes precedence over effort retention**.

---

### **Rule 3.8 — Concurrency Without Authority Amplification**

Concurrency within the Workflow Spine is permitted.

Concurrency **shall not** create multiple authoritative outcomes, amplify authority, or alter legitimacy criteria.

For any artifact lineage, **at most one authoritative state may exist**.

---

* Blueprint V2 §11.11 — Concurrency within the Workflow Spine

**Derivation Statement:**

* Workflow Spine treated strictly as legitimacy structure
* No procedural sequencing, execution guidance, or orchestration semantics introduced
* No new stages, authority rules, or coordination mechanisms added

---

## Chapter 4 — Operating Role Mode Validity Constraints

---

### **Rule 4.1 — Single Active Role Mode Requirement**

For any given action, an actor **shall operate under exactly one active Role Mode**.

Simultaneous, overlapping, or combined Role Modes are prohibited.

Any action performed under multiple, ambiguous, or unspecified Role Modes is invalid.

---

### **Rule 4.2 — Action Validity Bound to Active Role Mode**

Validity of any operating-level action **shall be evaluated exclusively with respect to the active Role Mode** under which the action is performed.

Correctness, usefulness, efficiency, or outcome quality **shall not substitute for Role Mode legitimacy**.

Actions exceeding the permissions or violating the prohibitions of the active Role Mode are invalid.

---

### **Rule 4.3 — Prohibition of Implicit Role Mode Switching**

Role Mode switching **shall not be implicit**.

Behavioral change, task type, execution context, or outcome **shall not** be interpreted as a Role Mode transition.

Any action performed without an explicitly authorized Role Mode transition is invalid.

---

### **Rule 4.4 — Role Mode Isolation under Concurrency**

Concurrency **shall not weaken Role Mode isolation**.

Parallel execution, multi-agent activity, or simultaneous task streams **shall not** combine Role Modes, share permissions across Role Modes, or produce cross–Role Mode authority effects.

Each action is evaluated independently against the Role Mode under which it was performed.

---

### **Rule 4.5 — Role Mode Violation Invalidity**

A Role Mode violation occurs when an action exceeds the permissions of the active Role Mode or violates an explicit prohibition of that Role Mode.

Outputs resulting from Role Mode violations:

* Are ineligible for acceptance
* Are ineligible for freeze
* Produce no authoritative effect

Such outputs are institutionally invalid.

---

### **Rule 4.6 — Builder Mode Operating Constraints**

Builder Mode is a constrained composite Role Mode.

At the operating level, Builder Mode **shall not**:

* Modify Blueprint or Canon artifacts
* Grant, escalate, or redefine authority
* Authorize Role Mode changes
* Perform governance actions

All outputs produced under Builder Mode are speculative by default.

---

### **Rule 4.7 — Prohibition of Role Mode–Based Authority Escalation**

Role Mode **shall not** be used as a mechanism to escalate authority.

Operating behavior **shall not** treat Role Mode assignment, duration, or execution success as grounds for granting additional permissions, acquiring authority, or bypassing governance constraints.

Any authority escalation attempt via Role Mode misuse is invalid.

---

### **Rule 4.8 — Role Mode as Legitimacy Prerequisite**

No operating-level action is eligible for acceptance, validation, or state update **unless it was performed under a valid, authorized Role Mode**.

Outputs lacking Role Mode legitimacy are ineligible for authority under all circumstances.

---

**Derivation Statement:**

* No Role Mode definitions altered
* No authorization procedures introduced
* No permissions or prohibitions extended beyond Blueprint

---

## Chapter 5 — Authority & Validity Constraints at Operating Level

---

### **Rule 5.1 — Artifact-State as the Sole Carrier of Authority**

Within AI Workflow OS, **authority exists exclusively as a property of artifact state**.

Authority **shall not** arise from authorship, intelligence, capability, execution success, repetition, consensus, or any execution-side property.

Any operating behavior attributing authority outside artifact state is invalid.

---

### **Rule 5.2 — Acceptance as the Exclusive Grant of Authority**

Acceptance is the **only mechanism** by which an artifact becomes eligible to carry authority.

An artifact that has not been explicitly accepted **shall not** be treated as authoritative under any circumstances.

Any operating behavior treating unaccepted artifacts as authoritative is invalid.

---

### **Rule 5.3 — Freeze as Preservation of Authority Across Time**

Freeze preserves authority by fixing the authoritative state of an accepted artifact in time.

Once frozen, an artifact **shall not** be modified, silently replaced, retroactively altered, or conditionally reinterpreted.

Any operating behavior that mutates or weakens frozen authority is invalid.

---

### **Rule 5.4 — Non-Exchangeability of Authority, Validity, and Legitimacy**

Authority, validity, and legitimacy are **distinct and non-exchangeable properties**.

At the operating level, **no degree of validity or legitimacy shall be inferred to produce authority**, and authority **shall not** be inferred from any other property.

Any operating behavior that substitutes or derives authority from validity or legitimacy is invalid.

---

### **Rule 5.5 — Prohibition of Authority Accumulation via Execution**

Authority **shall not accumulate** through execution success, repetition, reliability, performance, or volume of output.

No execution system, agent, or actor acquires authority by producing correct, useful, repeated, or superior outcomes.

Operating patterns that treat execution performance as authority are invalid.

---

### **Rule 5.6 — Prohibition of Authority Amplification through Concurrency**

Concurrency **shall not amplify authority**.

Parallel execution, multiple agents, or repeated submissions **shall not** increase the authority of any artifact or outcome.

For any artifact lineage, authority may exist **only** through explicit acceptance and freeze.

---

### **Rule 5.7 — Authority Persistence under Conflict**

Authority, once granted and frozen, **persists independently of subsequent execution outcomes, failures, or conflicting drafts**.

Conflicting proposals, alternative executions, or later results **shall not** weaken, override, or erode existing authority.

Authority change occurs **only** through explicit supersession governed by higher authority.

---

### **Rule 5.8 — Prohibition of Implicit Authority Transitions**

Authority transitions **shall not be implicit**.

Authority **shall not** be inferred from workflow position, execution stage completion, validation outcome, elapsed time, or operational convenience.

Any operating behavior producing authority effect without explicit acceptance or supersession is invalid.

---

* Blueprint V2 §12.9 — Authority Persistence under Failure

**Derivation Statement:**

* No new authority semantics introduced
* No authorization, audit, or procedural logic added
* Authority properties restated strictly at operating level

---

## Chapter 6 — Authorization Constraints (Operating Perspective)

---

### **Rule 6.1 — Authorization as an Explicit Governance Event**

Authorization exists **only** as an explicit governance event.

Authorization **shall not** be inferred from behavior, capability, seniority, historical contribution, execution success, system configuration, or practice.

Any operating behavior treating authorization as implicit, emergent, or assumed is invalid.

---

### **Rule 6.2 — Authorization Validity Requires Explicit Record and Attribution**

Authorization is valid **only if it is explicitly recorded and attributable to a permitted authority**.

Any authorization lacking explicit record or attribution is invalid.

Any operating action relying on invalid authorization is invalid.

---

### **Rule 6.3 — Role Mode Assignment Bound to Authorization**

An actor **shall not operate under any Role Mode** unless that Role Mode has been explicitly authorized.

Role Mode assignment **shall not** be inferred from task type, execution context, output characteristics, or execution behavior.

Any action performed under an unauthorized Role Mode is invalid.

---

### **Rule 6.4 — Temporal Validity of Authorization**

Authorization is **temporally scoped**.

Authorization applies **only** within its explicitly defined validity window.

Actions performed outside the valid temporal scope of authorization are invalid, regardless of outcome quality.

---

### **Rule 6.5 — Prohibition of Retroactive Authorization**

Authorization **shall not be retroactive**.

No authorization event may legitimize actions performed prior to the effective time of authorization.

Any operating behavior treating authorization as retroactively legitimizing prior actions is invalid.

---

### **Rule 6.6 — Prohibition of Authorization Escalation**

Authorization **shall not** be escalated implicitly.

No actor may escalate its own authorization, grant itself additional Role Modes, or extend the scope or duration of authorization through execution behavior.

Any operating pattern that escalates authorization without explicit governance action is invalid.

---

### **Rule 6.7 — Immediate Effect of Authorization Revocation**

Authorization is revocable.

Upon revocation, authorization **ceases to have effect immediately**.

Actions performed after authorization revocation are invalid, regardless of prior authorization state.

---

### **Rule 6.8 — Independence of Authorization from Capability**

Authorization is **independent of capability**.

Capability may inform authorization decisions but **shall not substitute for authorization**.

Any operating behavior treating capability as authorization is invalid.

---

### **Rule 6.9 — Authorization as a Legitimacy Prerequisite**

Authorization is a **necessary precondition** for operating-level legitimacy.

No operating-level action is eligible for acceptance, validation, or state update unless it was performed under valid authorization.

Outputs produced without valid authorization are ineligible for authority under all circumstances.

---

* Blueprint V2 §8.3 — Capability Does Not Confer Authority or Permission

**Derivation Statement:**

* No authorization procedures or workflows introduced
* No delegation, escalation, or automation mechanisms added
* Authorization treated strictly as explicit, attributable governance event

---

## Chapter 7 — System State & Continuity Constraints

---

### **Rule 7.1 — Artifact-Derived System State Definition**

Within AI Workflow OS, **system state exists exclusively as an artifact-derived fact**.

System state consists of **only those authoritative artifacts sufficient to establish current governance position and authority**, and nothing beyond them.

Any purported system state not derivable from authoritative artifacts is invalid.

---

### **Rule 7.2 — Exclusivity of Institutional Memory**

Only **institutional memory**, embodied in accepted and frozen artifacts, constitutes authoritative system memory.

Conversational history, model context, execution-side memory, internal recall, or undocumented understanding **shall not** be recognized as system memory.

Any operating behavior relying on non-artifact memory to determine system state is invalid.

---

### **Rule 7.3 — Independence from Conversational Continuity**

System continuity **shall not depend** on conversational persistence, session context, or model memory.

Loss of conversation history **shall not** invalidate system state, alter authority, or justify interpretive reconstruction.

Any operating pattern that assumes conversational continuity as a system requirement is invalid.

---

### **Rule 7.4 — Cold Start as a Mandatory Operating Condition**

Cold start is a **mandatory operating condition**.

A system state is valid **only if it can be reconstructed exclusively from authoritative artifacts without reliance on prior conversational or execution context**.

Failure to meet this condition constitutes a governance failure.

---

### **Rule 7.5 — Authority-Constrained State Mutation**

System state **shall not** be mutated by execution, inference, or interpretation.

State mutation occurs **only** through explicit governance actions, including acceptance, freeze, or supersession.

Any operating behavior mutating system state outside explicit governance action is invalid.

---

### **Rule 7.6 — Prohibition of Hidden or Implicit State**

Hidden, implicit, inferred, or execution-side state **shall not** be recognized as system state.

Unstated assumptions, informal agreements, cached context, or model-internal memory **shall not** participate in state evaluation.

If state cannot be reconstructed from authoritative artifacts, it does not exist within the system.

---

### **Rule 7.7 — Temporal Integrity of System State**

System state preserves **temporal integrity**.

Accepted and frozen artifacts define immutable historical authority at specific points in time.

Later actions may supersede but **shall not rewrite** historical authority.

Any operating behavior that retroactively alters historical state is invalid.

---

### **Rule 7.8 — Continuity under Failure and Interruption**

System continuity **shall be preserved** under execution failure, agent failure, model failure, network interruption, or human absence.

Such failures **shall not** corrupt authoritative artifacts or invalidate system state.

Any operating behavior that treats execution failure as governance failure is invalid.

---

### **Rule 7.9 — Prohibition of Interpretive Reconstruction**

Resumption of work **shall not rely on interpretive reconstruction** of intent, context, or history.

Any requirement to infer, guess, or reconstruct governance-relevant meaning beyond authoritative artifacts indicates insufficient externalization and is invalid.

---

* No recovery, storage, or resumption procedures added
* Constraints restated strictly at operating level

---

## Chapter 8 — Auditability & Traceability as Institutional Requirements

---

### **Rule 8.1 — Auditability as a Validity Condition**

Any action that confers, preserves, modifies, or revokes authority **is valid only if it is auditable**.

Auditability, as a validity condition, requires that the authority effect be **explicit, attributable, and artifact-backed**.

Any operating behavior producing authority effects without auditability is invalid.

---

### **Rule 8.2 — Audit Scope Limited to Governance Artifacts**

Audit scope is limited **exclusively** to governance artifacts and governed state transitions.

Execution internals, model behavior, or execution-side reasoning **shall not** be treated as authoritative audit material unless explicitly externalized as artifacts.

Any operating behavior that treats non-artifact execution detail as authoritative audit evidence is invalid.

---

### **Rule 8.3 — Blueprint Traceability as a Legitimacy Requirement**

All operating-level governance artifacts **are legitimate only if they are traceable to explicit Blueprint provisions**.

Traceability requires that the lineage of governance authority can be reconstructed from artifacts **without interpretation or inference**.

Any governance artifact lacking Blueprint traceability is invalid.

---

### **Rule 8.4 — Explicit Recording as a Governance Requirement**

All governance-relevant actions and state transitions **must be explicitly recorded as artifacts**.

Implicit decisions, assumed acceptance, inferred freeze, or silent supersession are prohibited.

Any operating behavior relying on unrecorded governance action is invalid.

---

### **Rule 8.5 — Prohibition of Self-Audit and Self-Validation**

No execution system, agent, or actor **shall audit or validate its own authority-conferring actions**.

Audit and validation **must remain institutionally independent** from execution.

Any operating pattern that permits self-audit or self-validation is invalid.

---

### **Rule 8.6 — Detectability of Governance Violations**

Governance violations **must be explicitly detectable** through governance artifacts and governed transitions.

If a governance violation cannot be detected through artifacts, the governance design is insufficient and invalid.

Silent or undetectable governance violations are prohibited.

---

### **Rule 8.7 — Temporal Reconstructability of Authority**

Auditability and traceability **must remain reconstructable across time**.

Acceptance, freeze, supersession, and revocation events **must be recoverable from artifacts alone**, without reliance on memory, inference, or interpretation.

Any operating behavior that erodes reconstructability of authority over time is invalid.

---

## **Blueprint Traceability Tag — Chapter 8**

**Direct Sources:**

* Blueprint V2 §12.3 — Explicit Detectability Requirement
* Blueprint V2 §12.4 — Auditability of Authority Changes
* Blueprint V2 §12.5 — Audit Scope and Independence
* Blueprint V2 §5.9 — Auditability of Authorization
* Blueprint V2 §15.1–§15.6 — Canonical Authority, Precedence, and Binding Scope

**Derivation Statement:**

* No audit procedures, tools, or workflows introduced
* No evidence standards or validation methods specified
* Auditability and traceability treated strictly as institutional validity conditions

---

## Chapter 9 — Governance Violation & Failure Containment (Non-Procedural)

---

### **Rule 9.1 — Governance Violation as a Structural Condition**

A governance violation is a **structural condition**, not an assessment of intent, competence, or outcome quality.

A governance violation exists whenever actions, outputs, or transitions **conflict with binding governance constraints**, including invariants, Role Mode constraints, authorization requirements, authority and validity boundaries, or Workflow Spine constraints.

Any such conflict constitutes a governance violation.

---

### **Rule 9.2 — Invalidity of Outcomes Produced by Violations**

Outcomes produced under governance violations **are invalid by definition**.

Invalid outcomes:

* Are ineligible for acceptance
* Are ineligible for freeze
* Produce no authoritative effect

Outcome quality, usefulness, or execution success **shall not** mitigate invalidity.

---

### **Rule 9.3 — Failure Containment as a Mandatory Principle**

Governance violations **shall be explicitly contained**.

Containment prevents propagation of invalid state and preserves authority integrity.

Any operating behavior that permits invalid state to persist, propagate, or implicitly correct itself is invalid.

---

### **Rule 9.4 — Prohibition of Silent Correction**

Silent correction, silent override, silent rollback, or silent remediation **is prohibited**.

Any response to a governance violation **must be explicit and artifact-backed**.

Absence of explicit response to a detected governance violation constitutes a governance failure.

---

### **Rule 9.5 — Institutional Legitimacy of Rejection and Quarantine**

Rejection and quarantine are **institutionally legitimate containment outcomes**.

Rejection or quarantine:

* Produces no authoritative effect
* Preserves existing authority
* Does not require justification based on outcome quality

Use of rejection or quarantine **shall not** be interpreted as execution failure.

---

### **Rule 9.6 — Authority Preservation under Violation**

Existing authoritative artifacts **remain authoritative** despite governance violations elsewhere.

Governance violations **shall not** retroactively invalidate accepted or frozen authority.

Authority may change **only** through explicit supersession governed by higher authority.

---

### **Rule 9.7 — Isolation of Failure Scope**

Governance violations **shall be isolated to their scope of occurrence**.

A violation affecting one action, artifact, or transition **shall not** propagate authority invalidation to unrelated artifacts or state.

Any operating behavior allowing uncontrolled propagation of failure is invalid.

---

### **Rule 9.8 — Prohibition of Interpretive Reconstruction in Recovery**

Recovery from governance violations **shall not rely on interpretive reconstruction** of intent, context, or history.

Any recovery requiring inference beyond authoritative artifacts indicates insufficient externalization and is invalid.

---

### **Rule 9.9 — Prohibition of Blame-Based Governance**

Governance violation handling **shall not assign blame** based on actor identity, intelligence, intent, or performance.

Governance enforcement focuses exclusively on **structural consistency, authority preservation, and system continuity**.

Any operating behavior treating blame, trust, or reputation as governance criteria is invalid.

## Chapter 10 — Freeze, Version & Supersession Discipline

---

### **Rule 10.1 — Freeze as Preservation of Historical Authority**

Freeze preserves authority by fixing the authoritative state of an accepted artifact in time.

Once frozen, an artifact **shall not** be modified, silently replaced, conditionally reinterpreted, or retroactively altered.

Any operating behavior that mutates or weakens frozen authority is invalid.

---

### **Rule 10.2 — Immutability of Frozen Artifacts**

Frozen artifacts **are immutable in all governance-relevant respects**.

No operating behavior may alter, correct, reinterpret, or qualify a frozen artifact or its authority effect.

Any treatment of a frozen artifact as mutable is invalid.

---

### **Rule 10.3 — Supersession as the Only Forward-Looking Authority Change**

Supersession is the **only legitimate mechanism** by which future authority replaces existing authority.

Supersession **shall not** rewrite, reinterpret, or invalidate historical authority.

Any operating behavior that alters authority without explicit supersession is invalid.

---

### **Rule 10.4 — Non-Retroactivity of Supersession**

Supersession **is strictly forward-looking**.

Supersession affects authority **only from the point of supersession onward**.

Historical authority defined by frozen artifacts **remains authoritative** for its temporal scope.

Any operating behavior that applies supersession retroactively is invalid.

---

### **Rule 10.5 — Normative Force of Version Semantics**

Version semantics **are normative governance constraints**, not descriptive labels.

Misuse, misrepresentation, ambiguity, or bypassing of version semantics **invalidates** the affected artifact or authority claim.

Any operating behavior that treats version semantics as optional or informational is invalid.

---

### **Rule 10.6 — Prohibition of Silent Version Drift**

Version change **shall not be implicit**.

Silent modification, undocumented patching, or de facto version drift **is prohibited**.

Any operating behavior that introduces version change without explicit acceptance or supersession is invalid.

---

### **Rule 10.7 — Preservation of Historical Integrity under Change**

Historical authority **shall be preserved under all change**.

Evolution of governance artifacts **shall not** require reinterpretation, correction, or reconstruction of frozen history.

Any operating behavior that compromises historical integrity is invalid.

---

### **Rule 10.8 — Prohibition of Implicit Cross-Version Authority Propagation**

Authority **shall not propagate implicitly across versions**.

Artifacts governed under one authoritative version **shall not** inherit, assume, or imply authority under another version without explicit governance action.

Any operating behavior that allows implicit cross-version authority propagation is invalid.

## Chapter 11 — Operating-Level Non-Goals (Re-Frozen)

---

### **Rule 11.1 — Exclusion of Execution, Tooling, and Intelligence from Governance**

Operating-level governance **shall not execute, reason, infer, judge, decide, or act**.

The Operating Canon **shall not embed** execution logic, tooling, models, orchestration mechanisms, or intelligence of any kind.

Any operating behavior that treats governance artifacts as executable, reasoning, or decision-making entities is invalid.

---

### **Rule 11.2 — Exclusion of Autonomous Objective Generation**

Operating-level governance **shall not generate, infer, or modify objectives, intents, or goals**.

All intent must originate externally and be explicitly externalized.

Any operating behavior that treats governance as a source of objectives is invalid.

---

### **Rule 11.3 — Prohibition of Governance-Level Coordination or Orchestration**

Operating-level governance **shall not coordinate, synchronize, route, schedule, allocate, or orchestrate execution systems or agents**.

There exists **no governance-level coordination mechanism**.

Any operating behavior that introduces coordination, explicitly or implicitly, at the governance layer is invalid.

---

### **Rule 11.4 — Prohibition of Convenience-Driven Scope Expansion**

Convenience, efficiency, automation pressure, or execution cost **shall not justify expansion of operating-level governance scope**.

Operating-level governance **shall not** absorb responsibilities from execution systems, tools, or human actors.

Any operating behavior that expands governance scope for convenience is invalid.

---

### **Rule 11.5 — Prohibition of Implicit Learning or Adaptive Governance**

Operating-level governance **shall not learn, adapt, or evolve implicitly**.

Governance rules **shall not** change based on observed outcomes, patterns, or execution history.

Any governance evolution requires **explicit Blueprint-level supersession**.

Any operating behavior that treats governance as adaptive without supersession is invalid.

---

### **Rule 11.6 — Prohibition of Hidden State and Side Channels**

Operating-level governance **shall not rely on hidden state, side channels, or execution-side memory**.

Conversational context, internal model state, cached execution data, informal agreements, or undocumented assumptions **shall not** participate in governance.

Any operating behavior that introduces hidden state into governance is invalid.

---

### **Rule 11.7 — Non-Goals as Permanent Institutional Exclusions**

The non-goals restated in this chapter **are permanent institutional exclusions**, not temporary omissions or deferred features.

No Canon, Protocol, Specification, Template, or operating practice **may override, relax, or reinterpret** these non-goals.

Any change to these exclusions requires **explicit Blueprint-level supersession** and **cannot be achieved at the Canon layer**.

## Chapter 12 — Canon Closure & Binding Clause

---

### **Rule 12.1 — Binding Scope and Mandatory Inheritance**

Once accepted and frozen, the Operating Canon **is binding across the entire operating layer** of AI Workflow OS.

All Protocols, Specifications, Templates, and operational artifacts **must inherit and comply with** the constraints defined in this Canon.

Any operating behavior or lower-layer artifact within scope that conflicts with this Canon is invalid.

---

### **Rule 12.2 — Prohibition of Selective or Conditional Application**

The rules of this Canon **shall not be selectively applied**.

No rule may be ignored, bypassed, weakened, or conditionally enforced based on convenience, execution context, urgency, outcome quality, or practice.

Any operating behavior that applies this Canon selectively is invalid.

---

### **Rule 12.3 — Canon as Constraint Only**

The Operating Canon **functions solely as a set of institutional constraints**.

This Canon **shall not** be used as:

* An explanatory or justificatory document
* A rationale for governance decisions
* A motivation or defense for execution outcomes
* A training, instructional, or interpretive manual

Any use of this Canon beyond constraint enforcement is invalid.

---

### **Rule 12.4 — Prohibition of Interpretive or Discretionary Authority**

No actor, agent, committee, process, or artifact **may claim interpretive or discretionary authority** over this Canon.

This Canon **shall not be interpreted, exercised, or adapted with discretion**.

Where interpretation is required, authority rests **exclusively with the active Blueprint and the Project Owner**, not with this Canon.

---

### **Rule 12.5 — Conditions for Supersession**

This Canon **may be superseded only** through explicit governance action under an active Blueprint.

Canon-level modification, evolution, or reinterpretation **is prohibited**.

Implicit, partial, de facto, or practice-based supersession is invalid.

---

### **Rule 12.6 — Preservation of Historical Canon Authority**

Once frozen, this Canon **defines immutable institutional authority for its period of effect**.

Later supersession **shall not reinterpret, revise, or invalidate** the historical authority of this Canon.

All artifacts and actions accepted under this Canon remain governed by it for their temporal scope.

---

### **Rule 12.7 — Canon Closure Clause**

This Canon constitutes a **closed and complete set of operating-level governance constraints** derived from the active Blueprint.

No operating-level governance authority exists outside this Canon and the Blueprint.

Any claim of operating-level governance authority not grounded in this Canon or the Blueprint is invalid.
