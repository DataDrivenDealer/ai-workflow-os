# DRS — Execution First Anchor

## 1. Decision Identification
- Decision Type: Execution Anchor Definition
- Artifact Layer: Layer 3 — Planning & Decision Artifact
- Status: Active (Non-Authoritative)

## 2. Decision Intent
This document defines the **first permitted execution anchor** for the AI Workflow OS.

The purpose of this anchor is:
- To allow the system to enter execution safely
- To prevent premature expansion of execution scope
- To provide a concrete but minimal starting point for verification

This document does **not** define:
- A roadmap
- A workflow
- An execution strategy
- A system objective

## 3. Anchor Definition (Strict)

The first execution anchor is defined as:

> **Verification of governance safety and execution legitimacy loops, without any domain-specific application logic.**

Concretely, the initial execution anchor is limited to:
- Verifying that governance constraints can be respected during execution
- Verifying that execution outputs remain non-authoritative
- Verifying that role mode boundaries are enforceable in practice

No domain task, application logic, or project-specific execution is included in this anchor.

## 4. Explicit Exclusions (Binding Within This DRS)

The following are explicitly excluded from the first execution anchor:

- Any application project (e.g. DGSF)
- Any domain-specific logic or modeling
- Any performance optimization
- Any long-running execution
- Any automation, scheduling, or orchestration

Execution beyond governance verification is **out of scope** for this anchor.

## 5. Downstream Eligibility (Non-Binding)

Completion of this anchor may enable:
- Authoring of execution verification playbooks
- Collection of execution evidence
- Subsequent definition of execution expansion anchors

Completion of this anchor does **not**:
- Authorize a Roadmap
- Authorize application-level execution
- Confer authority to any execution output
