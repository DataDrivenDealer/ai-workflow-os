# **AI_WORKFLOW_OS_BLUEPRINT_V2**

**Version**: 2.0
**Status**: DRAFT (Content In Progress)
**System Type**: Foundational Governance Infrastructure
**Owner**: Project Owner
**Authority Level**: Constitutional

---

### **0. Preamble & Supersession**

#### 0.1 Purpose of Blueprint V2

This document defines **AI Workflow OS Blueprint V2**, the constitutional specification of the AI Workflow Operating System.

AI Workflow OS is a **governance-first infrastructure system** whose purpose is to define **authority, boundaries, continuity, and legitimacy** in AI-assisted workflows.
It exists to regulate how work is authorized, validated, and remembered, independent of who or what performs the work.

Blueprint V2 formalizes governance structures that were previously implicit or deferred, including role-based authorization, multi-agent coexistence, and explicit separation between execution intelligence and institutional authority.

---

#### 0.2 Limitations of Blueprint V1

Blueprint V1 established AI Workflow OS as an artifact-driven governance system.
It intentionally deferred explicit treatment of multi-agent execution, role-based authorization, and organizational-scale AI collaboration.

Blueprint V2 removes these assumptions and replaces them with explicit, enforceable structure.

---

#### 0.3 Supersession Rules (V1 → V2)

Upon acceptance and freeze of Blueprint V2:

* Blueprint V2 becomes the sole constitutional authority.
* Blueprint V1 is preserved as historical record and may not be modified.
* All dependent artifacts must be migrated, deprecated, or explicitly coexist under a recorded migration decision.

Selective mixing of V1 and V2 principles without formal migration is invalid.

---

#### 0.4 Scope of Constitutional Authority

This Blueprint defines system identity, authority models, role modes, execution legitimacy, and continuity constraints.

This Blueprint does not define implementations, tools, models, orchestration strategies, or domain-specific workflows.

Any attempt to introduce execution or optimization logic into this Blueprint is invalid by definition.

---

#### 0.5 Interpretive Boundaries

This Blueprint may define invariants, authority hierarchies, governance primitives, and structural constraints.

It may not define algorithms, scheduling heuristics, autonomous behavior, or optimization objectives.

Where ambiguity exists, interpretation must favor governance clarity over execution convenience.

---

## **1. System Identity & Positioning**

#### 1.1 Governance-First Operating System

AI Workflow OS is a governance operating system.

Its function is to regulate how work is defined, authorized, validated, and preserved.
It does not execute work.

---

#### 1.2 File-System–Anchored Institutional Memory

AI Workflow OS exists as a persistent, externalized system of record anchored in artifacts.

What is not externalized does not exist.
What is not frozen is not authoritative.
What is not accepted is not legitimate.

Conversation and transient context are non-authoritative.

---

#### 1.3 Governance–Execution Separation

AI Workflow OS enforces a strict separation between governance artifacts and execution systems.

Execution systems may read governance artifacts and produce speculative outputs.
They may not define authority, commit state, or self-validate outcomes.

---

#### 1.4 One-Directional Dependency

All dependencies flow from AI Workflow OS to execution systems.

Reverse dependency is prohibited.

---

#### 1.5 Non-Executing, Non-Intelligent Infrastructure

AI Workflow OS does not execute, optimize, or reason.

Treating the OS as an intelligent actor constitutes a category error under this Blueprint.

---

#### 1.6 Implications

Because of this positioning:

* Execution capability does not confer authority.
* Smarter systems may explore more, but never decide more.
* System continuity does not depend on memory, models, or availability.

Stability is achieved through governance, not intelligence.

---

## **2. Core Design Invariants**

### 2.1 Invariants as Constitutional Constraints

The invariants defined in this chapter are **non-negotiable constitutional constraints** of the AI Workflow OS.

They do not express preferences, recommendations, or best practices.
They define the conditions under which the system remains valid.

Any artifact, protocol, execution pattern, or interpretation that violates these invariants is invalid by definition.

For the purpose of this Blueprint, the following distinctions are frozen:

- Authority defines what may become system truth.
- Legitimacy defines whether an action or outcome is eligible to receive authority.
- Validity defines whether an action conforms to structural and procedural constraints.

These concepts are non-interchangeable throughout this document.

---

### 2.2 Artifact over Conversation

All authoritative system state must be externalized as artifacts.

Conversation, transient context, prompt history, and model memory are non-authoritative.
They may inform execution but may not define truth.

If a fact, decision, or outcome is not recorded as an artifact, it does not exist within the system.

---

### 2.3 Explicit Authority over Implicit Intelligence

Authority within AI Workflow OS is never inferred from intelligence, capability, autonomy, or performance.

No execution system may acquire authority implicitly, regardless of sophistication.
Authority exists only through explicit governance artifacts and owner acceptance.

Execution intelligence may explore.
Governance authority decides.

---

### 2.4 Single Source of Truth via Freeze and Acceptance

At any point in time, there exists exactly one source of authoritative truth:
the set of frozen, owner-accepted artifacts.

Drafts, proposals, execution outputs, and speculative results are non-authoritative until explicitly accepted and frozen.

Freezing preserves historical truth.
Acceptance confers legitimacy.

Silent mutation is prohibited.

---

### 2.5 Execution Is Always Speculative

All execution is speculative by default.

Execution may be exploratory, parallel, iterative, or autonomous.
Execution outputs may be discarded without consequence.

Execution does not commit state and does not create authority.

---

### 2.6 Authority Is Never Speculative

Authority is binary and explicit.

A change is either authoritative or it is not.
There is no provisional, probabilistic, or emergent authority state.

Authority exists only through explicit acceptance, explicit freeze, and explicit ownership.

---

### 2.7 Model, Tool, and Environment Agnosticism

AI Workflow OS is agnostic to models, tools, agents, orchestration frameworks, and execution environments.

No invariant may assume the availability, stability, or legality of any specific execution substrate.

System continuity must remain achievable under model replacement and cold start.

---

### 2.8 No Hidden State

All **system-relevant state** must be reconstructable from artifacts.

Implicit assumptions, unstated decisions, and execution-side memory are invalid as system state.

If state cannot be reconstructed from artifacts, it is not part of the system.

---

### 2.9 No Implicit Transitions

All **state transitions** must be explicit and artifact-backed.

Inferred completion, assumed acceptance, or implicit progression is prohibited.

Every transition must be observable, reviewable, and auditable.

---

### 2.10 Legitimacy Is Not Exchangeable with Productivity

Productivity does not confer legitimacy.

Execution speed, autonomy, or output volume cannot be exchanged for authority.

Conversely, constrained execution does not diminish legitimacy.

---

### 2.11 Failure Is Contained, Not Corrected Silently

Failures must be surfaced explicitly.

Silent correction, silent override, or silent rollback is prohibited.

Failure containment occurs through rejection, discard, or explicit remediation artifacts.

---

### 2.12 Invariant Precedence

In the event of conflict:

* Core invariants override convenience
* Governance overrides execution
* Explicit artifacts override implicit behavior

If an invariant prevents a desired execution pattern, the execution pattern is invalid.

---

### 2.13 Implications of the Invariants

Collectively, these invariants ensure that:

* Intelligence can scale without destabilizing governance
* Multiple agents can coexist without corrupting truth
* Authority remains legible, auditable, and revocable
* Continuity does not depend on any single model or tool

The system remains stable by design, not by discipline.

---

## **3. Role Mode Model**

### 3.1 Role Mode as a Constitutional Construct

A **Role Mode** is a constitutionally defined execution context that determines which actions are legitimate within AI Workflow OS.

Role Mode is neither a persona nor a prompt configuration.
It is a governance construct that binds permissions, prohibitions, and legitimacy conditions to actions.

An action is valid only if performed under an explicitly authorized Role Mode.

Terminology hierarchy used in this Blueprint is frozen as follows:

- Actor: any participant capable of performing actions within the system.
- Agent: an AI-based actor.
- Execution System: the technical substrate enabling execution by an actor or agent.

These terms are not interchangeable unless explicitly stated.


---

### 3.2 Distinction Between Role, Role Mode, and Capability

AI Workflow OS distinguishes three orthogonal concepts:

* **Role**
  An organizational identity describing responsibility.

* **Role Mode**
  A formally authorized execution context that determines which actions are permitted.

* **Capability**
  An execution-side property describing what an actor is technically able to do.

Capability does not imply permission.
Role does not imply authority.
Only Role Mode confers legitimacy.

---

### 3.3 Role Mode Governs Actions, Not Actors

Role Mode governs the legitimacy of actions, not the identity or intelligence of the actor.

An actor may operate under different Role Modes at different times, subject to authorization.
An actor may not implicitly combine, overlap, or switch Role Modes.

All outputs are evaluated relative to the active Role Mode under which they were produced.

---

### 3.4 Canonical Role Modes

AI Workflow OS defines a minimal set of canonical Role Modes.
This list is intentionally constrained.

#### 3.4.1 Architect Mode

Architect Mode governs constitutional and structural design.

Under Architect Mode, an actor may propose modifications to:

* Blueprint drafts
* Canon drafts
* Governance-level structures

Architect Mode does not grant execution authority.
All outputs remain non-authoritative until accepted and frozen.

---

#### 3.4.2 Planner Mode

Planner Mode governs planning, decomposition, and specification.

Under Planner Mode, an actor may:

* Define plans, roadmaps, and specifications
* Decompose intent into structured tasks
* Define validation criteria

Planner Mode may not modify constitutional artifacts and does not grant execution authority.

---

#### 3.4.3 Executor Mode

Executor Mode governs execution and implementation.

Under Executor Mode, an actor may:

* Perform execution tasks
* Produce artifact drafts
* Generate evidence and execution trace

Executor Mode may not define requirements, validate outcomes, or commit state.

---

#### 3.4.4 Builder Mode (Constrained Composite Mode)

Builder Mode is a constrained composite Role Mode designed solely for execution efficiency.

Builder Mode permits limited planning activities strictly necessary for execution, in addition to execution itself.

Builder Mode is **not** a union of Planner Mode and Executor Mode.
All prohibitions applicable to Planner Mode and Executor Mode remain in effect.

Builder Mode:

* May not modify Blueprint or Canon artifacts
* May not authorize role changes
* Produces outputs that are speculative by default

Builder Mode exists to reduce coordination overhead, not to expand authority.

---

### 3.5 Role Mode Permission Boundaries

Each Role Mode defines explicit permission boundaries.

Permissions specify:

* Which artifact types may be read
* Which artifact types may be proposed or modified (draft-only)
* Which actions are explicitly prohibited

Exceeding a permission boundary renders the action invalid.

---

### 3.6 Role Mode Exclusivity and Concurrency

An actor operates under exactly one Role Mode at any given time.

Concurrent execution is permitted.
Concurrent Role Modes are prohibited.

This distinction ensures deterministic evaluation of legitimacy under parallel execution.

---

### 3.7 Role Mode and Legitimacy

Legitimacy of any output is evaluated relative to the Role Mode under which it was produced.

Correctness, usefulness, or quality cannot substitute for legitimacy.

Outputs produced under an unauthorized or inappropriate Role Mode are invalid.

---

### 3.8 Role Mode Violations

A Role Mode violation occurs when an action exceeds the permissions of the active Role Mode.

Role Mode violations constitute governance violations.

Outputs resulting from violations:

* May not be accepted
* May not be frozen
* Must be explicitly rejected or quarantined

---

### 3.9 Role Mode as Foundation for Authorization

Role Mode is the foundational unit for all authorization decisions.

Initial authorization, role assignment, role switching, and authorization revocation are governed events defined elsewhere.

No action may be evaluated without reference to an active Role Mode.

---

### 3.10 Implications of the Role Mode Model

The Role Mode Model ensures that:

* Intelligence does not imply authority
* Capability does not imply permission
* Efficiency does not imply legitimacy
* Governance remains legible under scale and concurrency

Discipline is enforced structurally, not procedurally.

---

## **4. Authority & Permission System**

### 4.1 Authority as a Structural Property

Within AI Workflow OS, **authority is a structural property of the system**, not a behavioral attribute of actors.

Authority does not arise from intelligence, capability, seniority, productivity, or execution quality.
Authority arises solely from explicit governance structure defined by this Blueprint.

---

### 4.2 Authority Hierarchy

AI Workflow OS enforces a strict, non-circular authority hierarchy.

From highest to lowest:

1. **Project Owner Authority**
2. **Frozen Artifacts**
3. **Active Authoritative Artifacts**
4. **Non-Authoritative Outputs**

Authority flows downward only.
Lower levels may not override higher levels.

---

### 4.3 Artifact-Centric Authority

Authority is bound to **artifact state**, not to authorship, role, or capability.

An artifact’s authority is determined exclusively by:

* Its classification
* Its acceptance status
* Its freeze status

The producer of an artifact has no bearing on its authority.

---

### 4.4 Acceptance as the Sole Grant of Authority

Acceptance is the sole mechanism by which authority is conferred.

Acceptance must be:

* Explicit
* Attributable
* Recorded

An unaccepted artifact has no authority, regardless of correctness or utility.

---

### 4.5 Freeze as Preservation of Authority

Freeze preserves authority across time.

A frozen artifact defines immutable historical truth.
It may not be altered and may only be superseded through explicit governance action.

Freeze separates historical truth from active intent.

---

### 4.6 Permission as a Function of Role Mode

Permissions define which actions are permitted under a given Role Mode.

Permissions constrain:

* What artifacts may be read
* What artifacts may be proposed or modified (draft-only)
* What governance actions are prohibited

Permissions constrain behavior.
Permissions do not grant authority.

---

### 4.7 Explicit Prohibitions

Explicit prohibitions are first-class governance constraints.

Actions that violate constitutional or role-based prohibitions are invalid by definition and produce no authoritative effect.

---

### 4.8 Authority and Permission Are Non-Exchangeable

Authority and permission are orthogonal and non-exchangeable.

Permission allows an action to be attempted.
Authority determines whether an outcome may become truth.

Permission cannot be converted into authority by execution, repetition, or success.

---

### 4.9 Role Mode–Scoped Authority Constraints

Role Modes impose hard constraints on authority escalation.

No Role Mode other than explicitly authorized governance roles may grant authority, accept artifacts, or freeze artifacts.

Builder Mode explicitly prohibits authority escalation under all circumstances.

---

### 4.10 Authority Evaluation and Invalidity

Authority is a property evaluated against governance constraints, not execution sequence.

Actions may be executed yet later deemed invalid due to role, permission, or authority violations.

Invalid actions produce no authoritative effect and must be explicitly rejected or quarantined.

---

### 4.11 Auditability of Authority

All authority-conferring actions must be auditable.

This includes acceptance, freeze, supersession, and revocation.

Auditability requires explicit recording, attribution, and traceability.

---

### 4.12 Conflict Resolution

In the event of conflict:

* Higher authority overrides lower authority
* Frozen artifacts override active drafts
* Explicit governance overrides implicit assumption

Conflicts may not be resolved implicitly.

---

### 4.13 Implications of the Authority & Permission System

This system ensures that:

* Authority cannot drift through automation or intelligence
* Permissions constrain behavior without granting power
* Historical truth remains stable under scale and concurrency
* Governance remains legible, enforceable, and reversible

Authority is exercised deliberately, sparingly, and visibly.

---

## **5. Authorization & Role Assignment Events**

### 5.1 Authorization as a Governance Event

Within AI Workflow OS, **authorization is an explicit governance event**.

Authorization defines the Role Mode under which an actor’s actions may be considered legitimate.
Authorization is not an implicit state, assumption, or behavioral inference.

Authorization exists only if it is explicitly granted, explicitly recorded, and attributable to an authorized authority.

For the purposes of this Blueprint, a Governance Action is defined as any explicit,
authorized act that mutates authority, system state, or governance scope.

Execution activities may propose changes but may never constitute Governance Actions.

---

### 5.2 Classes of Authorization Events

AI Workflow OS recognizes multiple classes of authorization events, including but not limited to:

* Initial authorization
* Role Mode assignment
* Role Mode switching
* Authorization downgrade
* Authorization revocation

Each constitutes an independent governance event.
No authorization class implies or subsumes another.

---

### 5.3 Initial Authorization

Initial authorization establishes that an actor is permitted to operate within the system under a specified Role Mode.

Without initial authorization, all system-relevant actions by the actor are invalid by definition.

Initial authorization does not confer authority beyond the permissions of the assigned Role Mode.

---

### 5.4 Role Mode Assignment and Switching

Role Mode assignment and Role Mode switching are governed authorization events.

An actor may operate under different Role Modes over time, subject to authorization.
Only one Role Mode may be active at any given time.

Implicit, inferred, or behavioral Role Mode switching is prohibited.

---

### 5.5 Constraints on Role Escalation

Role escalation is strictly constrained.

No actor may:

* Escalate its own Role Mode
* Grant itself additional permissions
* Assume a higher-authority Role Mode through execution behavior

All escalation requires explicit authorization by a permitted authority.

---

### 5.6 Role Downgrade and Revocation

Authorization is revocable.

Downgrades and revocations:

* Take effect immediately upon record
* Do not require actor consent
* Do not invalidate previously accepted artifacts

Subsequent actions under a revoked or downgraded Role Mode are invalid.

---

### 5.7 Temporal Scope of Authorization

Authorization is temporally scoped.

Authorization applies only within its explicitly defined validity window.
Authorization cannot retroactively legitimize prior actions.

Actions performed outside the valid authorization window are invalid regardless of outcome quality.

---

### 5.8 Authorization and Capability Independence

Authorization is independent of capability.

Capability may inform authorization decisions but does not substitute for authorization.

No degree of competence or performance may compensate for lack of authorization.

---

### 5.9 Auditability of Authorization

All authorization events must be auditable.

Auditability requires that authorization decisions be:

* Explicit
* Attributable
* Traceable across time

The specific recording format is defined outside this Blueprint.

---

### 5.10 Authorization Violations

An authorization violation occurs when an actor performs an action without valid authorization or outside the authorized Role Mode.

Authorization violations constitute governance violations.

Outputs resulting from authorization violations:

* May not be accepted
* May not be frozen
* Must be explicitly rejected or quarantined

---

### 5.11 Authorization as Foundation for Accountability

Authorization establishes accountability by binding actions to recorded governance decisions.

Accountability arises from explicit structure, not from trust or intention.

---

### 5.12 Implications of the Authorization Model

This model ensures that:

* No action is legitimate without explicit permission
* No permission silently expands or persists
* Role boundaries remain enforceable under scale and concurrency
* Authority remains decoupled from intelligence and execution output

Governance remains explicit, auditable, and reversible.

---

## **6. Execution Model & Speculative Work**

### 6.1 Execution as a Non-Authoritative Activity

Within AI Workflow OS, **execution is non-authoritative by definition**.

Execution encompasses any activity that produces outputs intended to advance system goals.
Execution may create value.
Execution may not create legitimacy.

No execution outcome becomes authoritative without explicit governance action.

---

### 6.2 Speculative Execution as Default

All execution is speculative by default.

Speculative execution is permitted to explore, iterate, and fail.
Speculative execution does not commit state and does not define truth.

Speculation is a property of execution, not a pathway to authority.

---

### 6.3 Separation Between Execution and Commitment

Execution and commitment are structurally disjoint.

Execution produces drafts, proposals, evidence, and trace.
Commitment confers legitimacy through acceptance and freeze.

No execution activity may directly or indirectly trigger commitment.

---

### 6.4 Concurrency Without Authority Amplification

Parallel and iterative execution is permitted.

Multiple speculative executions may occur concurrently and may produce incompatible outcomes.
Concurrency at the execution level has no effect on authority.

At most one authoritative outcome may exist for any given artifact lineage.

---

### 6.5 Discardability as a First-Class Property

Discardability is a first-class property of execution outputs.

Speculative outputs may be rejected, superseded, or abandoned without consequence.
Discarding work does not require justification and does not constitute failure.

Legitimacy clarity takes precedence over effort preservation.

---

### 6.6 Evidence and Trace as Evaluation Preconditions

Execution outputs must be **evaluatable**.

Evidence and trace enable validation, audit, and review.
They support governance decisions but do not themselves confer authority.

The sufficiency and form of evidence are defined outside this Blueprint.

---

### 6.7 Execution Independence from Intelligence Level

The execution model is independent of intelligence, autonomy, or orchestration level.

Execution sophistication affects productivity only.
Legitimacy remains governed exclusively by governance structure.

---

### 6.8 Execution Under Authorization Constraints

Execution may occur without valid authorization, but such execution is **ineligible for acceptance**.

Outputs produced outside authorized Role Mode boundaries may not become authoritative under any circumstances.

Authorization constrains legitimacy, not the ability to attempt execution.

---

### 6.9 Execution Failures and Invalid Outcomes

Execution failures and invalid outcomes are expected.

Outcomes conflicting with Role Mode, authorization, permissions, or higher-authority artifacts produce no authoritative effect and must be explicitly rejected or discarded.

---

### 6.10 No Self-Validation of Execution

Execution systems may not validate their own outputs.

Validation, acceptance, and freeze are governance actions performed outside the execution context.

Self-validation constitutes a governance violation.

---

### 6.11 Execution Does Not Accumulate Authority

Execution success, repetition, or reliability does not accumulate authority.

No execution system gains additional permissions or legitimacy through performance.

Authority remains fixed to governance structure.

---

### 6.12 Implications of the Execution Model

This model ensures that:

* Exploration scales without corrupting truth
* Autonomy increases without eroding governance
* Multiple execution strategies coexist safely
* Legitimacy remains legible and enforceable

Execution remains a tool.
Authority remains a governance decision.

---

## **7. Execution Backend Abstraction**

### 7.1 Execution Backend as an External Execution Provider

An **Execution Backend** is an external provider of execution capability.

An execution backend supplies means for execution but does not participate in system governance, authority, or structure.

Execution backends are not system components, roles, or governance actors.
They exist entirely outside the governance boundary of AI Workflow OS.

---

### 7.2 Backend Independence from Governance

AI Workflow OS is independent of any specific execution backend.

The OS must not depend on the presence, availability, or behavior of any execution backend.

Governance artifacts may not encode assumptions about backend capabilities, interfaces, or features.

---

### 7.3 Backend-Agnostic Execution Semantics

All execution backends are subject to identical execution semantics.

Regardless of backend characteristics:

* Execution outputs are speculative
* Authority is never backend-derived
* Acceptance and freeze are external governance actions

Backend intelligence or autonomy does not modify these semantics.

---

### 7.4 Coexistence of Multiple Execution Backends

Multiple execution backends may operate concurrently.

Backends may produce overlapping, conflicting, or incompatible outputs.

Concurrency among backends has no effect on authority resolution.
Artifact-level arbitration remains the sole coordination mechanism.

---

### 7.5 Backend Capability as an Execution-Side Fact

Execution backends may differ in capability.

Capability differences affect what execution is possible, not what outcomes are legitimate.

Capability is an execution-side fact and does not, by itself, participate in governance decisions.

---

### 7.6 Backend Degradation and Absence

Degradation or absence of execution backends does not invalidate the OS.

Execution scope and speed may change.
Authority, legitimacy, and historical truth do not.

---

### 7.7 Backend Output Submission Boundary

Execution backends interact with governance only by submitting outputs.

Submitted outputs may include drafts, proposals, evidence, and execution trace.

Submission does not imply evaluation, acceptance, or legitimacy.

---

### 7.8 No Backend-Driven Governance

Execution backends may not perform governance actions.

Backends may not:

* Assign or modify Role Modes
* Grant authorization
* Accept or freeze artifacts
* Modify system state

Any such attempt is invalid by definition.

---

### 7.9 Backend Failure and Isolation

Execution backend failure is isolated to execution outcomes.

Backend failure:

* Does not corrupt authoritative artifacts
* Does not invalidate accepted state
* Does not propagate into governance failure

---

### 7.10 Execution Backend Neutrality

The OS must remain neutral with respect to execution backend implementation, provider, intelligence level, and orchestration strategy.

Neutrality is a governance constraint, not a preference.

---

### 7.11 Implications of Execution Backend Abstraction

This abstraction ensures that:

* Execution capability may evolve independently of governance
* Multiple execution strategies coexist safely
* Backend replacement or failure does not threaten system continuity
* Authority integrity remains preserved under change

Execution backends are replaceable tools.
Governance remains the system of record.

---

## **8. Capability Awareness & Adaptive Governance**

### 8.1 Capability Awareness as a Governance Input

Within AI Workflow OS, **capability awareness exists solely as a governance input**.

Capability awareness informs how governance constraints are applied.
It does not initiate execution, select strategies, or produce actions.

Adaptation modifies constraints only; it never produces behavior.

---

### 8.2 Definition of Capability

A **capability** is an execution-side fact describing what an actor or execution backend is able to do under current conditions.

Capabilities describe factual conditions of execution.
They do not encode permission, authority, or obligation.

---

### 8.3 Capability Does Not Confer Authority or Permission

Capability does not grant authority.
Capability does not imply permission.

Authorization and permission are evaluated independently of capability.

---

### 8.4 Capability Declaration

Capability awareness arises through **explicit declaration** or observation.

Capability declarations are non-normative statements of execution-side fact.
They may be incomplete, inaccurate, or ignored.

Capability declarations do not request, grant, or imply permission.

---

### 8.5 Validation and Trust Boundaries

Capability declarations exist within explicit trust boundaries.

Governance may rely on, discount, or disregard declared capability.
Governance must assume that all capability information is fallible.

---

### 8.6 Adaptive Governance as Constraint Adjustment

Adaptive governance refers exclusively to **adjustment of governance constraints** in response to capability awareness.

Adaptive governance may restrict scope, tighten acceptance criteria, or increase validation requirements.

Adaptive governance may not initiate execution, assign tasks, schedule actors, or optimize workflows.

---

### 8.7 Task Granularity as a Governance Constraint

Task granularity is a governance constraint influenced by capability awareness.

Granularity adjustments affect what may be proposed or attempted.
Granularity adjustments do not affect legitimacy criteria or acceptance rules.

---

### 8.8 Capability Degradation and Uncertainty

Capability may degrade, fluctuate, or become unknown.

In the presence of uncertainty, governance must default to conservative constraints.

---

### 8.9 Capability Awareness in Multi-Agent Contexts

Capability awareness is evaluated per actor or per execution backend.

Capabilities are not transferable, inheritable, or aggregatable for governance purposes.

---

### 8.10 No Capability-Driven Orchestration

Capability awareness may not be used to orchestrate execution.

The OS must not route work, allocate tasks, or select execution strategies based on capability.

---

### 8.11 Capability Awareness and Legitimacy

Capability awareness affects eligibility for proposal only.

Legitimacy remains determined exclusively by Role Mode, authorization, acceptance, and freeze.

No degree of capability can legitimize an otherwise invalid action.

---

### 8.12 Implications of Capability Awareness & Adaptive Governance

This model ensures that governance adapts to execution reality without embedding intelligence.

Constraint adjustment replaces orchestration.
Legitimacy remains invariant under capability change.

---

## **9. Multi-Agent & Multi-Model Coexistence**

### 9.1 Coexistence as a System Assumption

AI Workflow OS assumes the **coexistence of multiple agents and multiple models** as a baseline condition.

Coexistence denotes simultaneous presence and activity within the same governance space.
It does not imply coordination, cooperation, communication, or collective intent.

Coexistence is a factual condition, not a system objective.

---

### 9.2 Agent and Model Neutrality

The OS is neutral with respect to agent identity, model architecture, provider, intelligence level, and autonomy.

No agent or model is privileged by default.
No agent or model is excluded by design.

Legitimacy is independent of agent or model characteristics.

---

### 9.3 Isolation by Role Mode

Each agent operates under **Role Mode isolation**.

All actions are evaluated solely within the context of the agent’s authorized Role Mode.
Role Mode boundaries prohibit implicit authority sharing, coordination, or escalation.

External communication among agents does not alter Role Mode isolation.

---

### 9.4 No Shared Cognitive State

AI Workflow OS recognizes no shared cognitive state among agents.

Conversation history, internal memory, or model state shared outside governance artifacts is non-authoritative.

Only artifacts constitute shared system state.

---

### 9.5 Artifact-Level Arbitration as the Sole Interaction Surface

All interactions among agents are mediated exclusively through artifacts.

When multiple agents produce overlapping or conflicting outputs:

* No agent may override another
* No negotiation or resolution occurs at the agent level
* Governance evaluates artifacts, not agents

Artifact-level arbitration is the **sole legitimate interaction surface** among agents.

---

### 9.6 Concurrency Without Coordination

Agents may execute concurrently without coordination.

Concurrency may increase exploration and throughput.
Concurrency does not create collective authority, shared decision-making, or precedence.

For any artifact lineage, at most one authoritative outcome may exist.

---

### 9.7 Heterogeneous Capability and Asymmetric Execution

Agents and models may differ significantly in capability.

Capability asymmetry affects execution scope and speed only.
It does not affect legitimacy, priority, or authority.

Stronger agents do not outrank weaker agents.

---

### 9.8 Failure Isolation Across Agents

Failure of one agent or model is isolated to its execution outcomes.

Agent failure:

* Does not corrupt authoritative artifacts
* Does not invalidate accepted state
* Does not propagate authority failure

Governance stability is preserved under partial or total agent failure.

---

### 9.9 No Collective Agency or Emergent Authority

AI Workflow OS explicitly rejects collective agency.

No group of agents—regardless of size, coordination, or agreement—may:

* Acquire authority
* Make binding decisions
* Validate outcomes

Authority remains singular, explicit, and artifact-bound.

---

### 9.10 Accountability Under Coexistence

Accountability is preserved through:

* Explicit authorization
* Role Mode attribution
* Artifact traceability

The presence of multiple agents does not dilute responsibility or attribution.

---

### 9.11 Implications of Multi-Agent & Multi-Model Coexistence

This model ensures that:

* Parallelism does not erode governance
* Model diversity does not fracture truth
* Autonomy does not accumulate authority
* System integrity remains stable under scale

Coexistence increases capacity, not power.

---

## **10. State, Memory & Continuity**

### 10.1 System State as an Artifact-Derived Fact

Within AI Workflow OS, **system state is an artifact-derived fact**.

System state consists of the **minimal sufficient set of authoritative artifacts** required to:

* Determine the current governance position
* Evaluate the legitimacy of actions
* Resume work without loss of authority or context

No state outside this artifact-derived set is recognized.

---

### 10.2 Institutional Memory and Cognitive Memory

AI Workflow OS distinguishes **institutional memory** from **cognitive memory**.

* **Institutional memory** is embodied exclusively in artifacts, acceptance records, and freeze history.
* **Cognitive memory** includes conversation history, model context, internal recall, and execution-side state.

Only institutional memory is authoritative.
Cognitive memory is non-authoritative and disposable.

---

### 10.3 Independence from Conversational Continuity

System continuity must not depend on conversational persistence.

Loss of conversation history, session context, or model memory must not:

* Invalidate system state
* Disrupt governance
* Alter legitimacy

Conversation may assist execution but never defines continuity.

---

### 10.4 Cold Start as a Governance Requirement

Cold start is a **governance requirement**, not an optional capability.

Any actor or execution backend must be able to:

* Enter the system without prior conversational context
* Reconstruct system state exclusively from artifacts
* Operate within authorized Role Modes

Inability to cold start constitutes a governance failure.

---

### 10.5 Model Replacement and Execution Substitution

AI Workflow OS remains valid under model replacement and execution substitution.

Replacing models, agents, or execution backends must not:

* Require reinterpretation of state
* Reopen accepted decisions
* Modify historical truth

Execution systems are replaceable.
Governance artifacts are not.

---

### 10.6 Authority over State Mutation

Authority to mutate system state is strictly constrained.

System state may change only through:

* Explicit acceptance
* Explicit freeze
* Explicit supersession

Execution activities may propose changes but may not mutate state.

---

### 10.7 No Hidden or Implicit State

No hidden, implicit, or execution-side state is recognized.

Unstated assumptions, informal agreements, or model-internal memory do not constitute system state.

If state cannot be reconstructed from artifacts, it is not part of the system.

---

### 10.8 Temporal Integrity of State

System state preserves temporal integrity.

Accepted and frozen artifacts define immutable historical truth at specific points in time.
Later actions may supersede but may not rewrite history.

Temporal integrity is preserved through freeze, not revision.

---

### 10.9 Continuity Under Failure and Interruption

System continuity must be preserved under failure and interruption.

Execution failure, agent failure, model failure, network interruption, or human absence must not:

* Corrupt system state
* Invalidate authority
* Disrupt historical truth

Failures may interrupt execution but must not alter governance.

---

### 10.10 Resumption Without Interpretive Reconstruction

Resumption of work must not require interpretive reconstruction.

Artifacts must be sufficient to:

* Identify the current governance phase
* Identify pending decisions
* Identify valid next actions

Any need to infer intent beyond artifacts indicates insufficient governance externalization.

---

### 10.11 Memory Minimization Principle

AI Workflow OS follows a **memory minimization principle**.

Only memory required for legitimacy, auditability, and continuity may persist.
All other memory is execution-side convenience and may be discarded.

Minimizing memory dependence increases system robustness.

---

### 10.12 Implications of State, Memory & Continuity

This model ensures that:

* Continuity survives model and agent turnover
* Authority remains stable under interruption
* Historical truth remains immutable
* Governance does not rely on recall, inference, or trust

The system remembers only what it must.

---

## **11. Workflow Spine (Mode-Aware)**

### 11.1 The Canonical Workflow Invariant

AI Workflow OS enforces a **single canonical workflow invariant**:

**Intent → Decision → Artifact → Execution → Validation → State Update**

This invariant defines the **only legitimate structure** by which work may progress.
Any work that cannot be mapped to this invariant is invalid within the system.

The workflow spine is a **legitimacy constraint**, not a recommended process.

---

### 11.2 Mode-Aware Enforcement

Every stage and transition within the workflow spine is **Mode-aware**.

Role Mode determines:

* Which stages an actor may participate in
* Which transitions an actor may initiate
* Which artifacts an actor may produce or modify

No transition is valid without an active, authorized Role Mode.

---

### 11.3 Intent (Non-Authoritative)

**Intent** expresses desired change, inquiry, or direction.

Intent:

* Is non-authoritative
* Creates no obligation
* Confers no permission

Intent must be externalized to be visible but does not advance authority.

---

### 11.4 Decision (Governance Act)

**Decision** converts intent into governed direction.

Decisions:

* Are explicit governance acts
* Are attributable and recordable
* Define what may proceed to artifact creation

Only authorized Role Modes may produce decisions.

---

### 11.5 Artifact (Authority Medium)

**Artifacts** externalize decisions into durable, inspectable form.

Artifacts:

* Are the sole medium of authority
* Encode governance state and constraints
* Are subject to acceptance and freeze

What is not externalized as an artifact does not exist within the system.

---

### 11.6 Execution (Speculative Only)

**Execution** produces speculative outputs derived from artifacts.

Execution:

* Is always non-authoritative
* Is constrained by Role Mode and authorization
* May occur in parallel or iteratively

Execution outcomes are never authoritative by themselves.

---

### 11.7 Validation (Eligibility Evaluation)

**Validation** evaluates execution outputs against governing artifacts.

Validation:

* Determines eligibility for acceptance
* Does not create authority
* Must be independent of execution

Self-validation is prohibited.

---

### 11.8 State Update (Authority Change)

**State Update** records authoritative change.

State update occurs only through:

* Explicit acceptance
* Explicit freeze
* Explicit supersession

All state update constraints defined in Section 10 apply.

State update is irreversible except by governed supersession.

---

### 11.9 Prohibition of Implicit Progression

Implicit progression between workflow stages is prohibited.

Completion may not be inferred.
Acceptance may not be assumed.
State may not be updated silently.

All progression must be explicit and artifact-backed.

---

### 11.10 Rejection and Discard as Legitimate Outcomes

Rejection and discard are legitimate outcomes of the workflow spine.

Discarded execution:

* Does not constitute failure
* Does not require justification
* Produces no authoritative effect

Governance clarity takes precedence over effort preservation.

---

### 11.11 Concurrency within the Workflow Spine

Concurrency is permitted within the workflow spine.

Multiple intents, executions, and validations may coexist.
Concurrency does not create multiple authoritative states.

For any artifact lineage, at most one authoritative state may exist.

---

### 11.12 Workflow Spine Independence

The workflow spine is independent of tools, models, execution backends, and orchestration mechanisms.

No implementation detail may alter, bypass, or replace the workflow invariant.

---

### 11.13 Implications of the Mode-Aware Workflow Spine

This spine ensures that:

* All work remains traceable
* Authority remains legible and singular
* Execution remains speculative
* Governance remains enforceable under scale and concurrency

The workflow spine is the system’s backbone, not a process suggestion.

---

## **12. Governance, Audit & Failure Containment**

### 12.1 Governance Violations as System Conditions

Within AI Workflow OS, a **governance violation** is a system condition defined by structural inconsistency, not by intent, competence, or outcome quality.

A governance violation exists whenever actions, outputs, or transitions conflict with:

* Core Design Invariants
* Role Mode constraints
* Authorization rules
* Authority and permission boundaries
* Workflow Spine requirements

Governance violations invalidate outcomes by definition.

---

### 12.2 Classification by Structural Impact

Governance violations are classified by **structural impact**, not by execution severity.

Classes include, but are not limited to:

* Role Mode violations
* Authorization violations
* Authority escalation attempts
* Implicit state mutation
* Implicit workflow progression
* Self-validation attempts

Classification determines containment scope, not culpability.

---

### 12.3 Explicit Detectability Requirement

All governance violations must be **explicitly detectable**.

If a violation cannot be detected through governance artifacts and transitions, the system design is insufficient.

Silent violations are prohibited.
Undetectable violations constitute governance design failure.

---

### 12.4 Auditability of Authority Changes

Auditability is a mandatory property of all authority-conferring actions.

Auditability requires that:

* All acceptance, freeze, supersession, and revocation events are recorded
* Attribution is explicit
* Temporal ordering is reconstructable from artifacts

Auditability enables verification of legitimacy without reliance on memory, inference, or trust.

---

### 12.5 Audit Scope and Independence

Audit scope is limited to governance artifacts and governed transitions.

Execution internals are out of scope unless externalized as artifacts.

Audit must be independent of execution.
No execution system may audit its own authority transitions.

---

### 12.6 Failure Containment as a Primary Objective

Failure containment takes precedence over failure correction.

When governance violations or failures occur:

* Invalid outcomes are rejected or quarantined
* Authority remains preserved
* Historical truth remains intact

Containment prevents propagation of invalid state.

---

### 12.7 Prohibition of Silent Correction

Silent correction, silent override, or silent rollback is prohibited.

Any remediation must be:

* Explicit
* Attributable
* Artifact-backed

Silence is treated as a governance failure.

---

### 12.8 Quarantine and Rejection

Invalid outputs may be:

* Rejected
* Quarantined
* Archived as non-authoritative record

Quarantine isolates potential damage without erasing evidence.
Rejection produces no authoritative effect.

---

### 12.9 Authority Persistence Under Failure

Execution failure, agent failure, or governance violation does not invalidate existing authoritative artifacts.

Authority persists unless explicitly superseded through governed process.

Failure affects future progression, not historical truth.

---

### 12.10 Recovery Without Interpretive Reconstruction

Recovery must not require reinterpretation of intent, history, or context.

Recovery proceeds by:

* Identifying violated constraints
* Rejecting invalid outcomes
* Resuming from the last authoritative state

Any need for interpretive reconstruction indicates insufficient externalization.

---

### 12.11 Accountability Without Blame

Governance enforces accountability without assigning blame.

Violation handling focuses on:

* Structural correction
* Authority preservation
* System continuity

Intent, fault, or model quality are irrelevant to governance validity.

---

### 12.12 Implications of Governance, Audit & Failure Containment

This model ensures that:

* Violations are detectable and containable
* Authority cannot be silently corrupted
* Failure does not cascade into system collapse
* Governance remains enforceable under scale and autonomy

The system survives not by avoiding failure, but by **containing it explicitly**.

---

## **13. Non-Goals & Explicit Deferrals**

### 13.1 Non-Goals as Constitutional Exclusions

Non-goals define constitutional exclusions, not temporary omissions.

They consolidate and reinforce prohibitions already defined throughout this Blueprint.

They specify system responsibilities that are **explicitly prohibited** within AI Workflow OS, regardless of future capability, tooling, or convenience.

Any proposal, interpretation, or extension that violates these exclusions is invalid by definition.

---

### 13.2 Prohibition of Embedded Execution or Tooling

AI Workflow OS **shall not embed** execution logic, tools, models, or orchestration mechanisms.

The OS is prohibited from:

* Executing tasks
* Invoking tools
* Running code
* Scheduling or coordinating agents

Embedding execution capability into governance constitutes a category error and violates this Blueprint.

---

### 13.3 Prohibition of Model Selection, Ranking, or Optimization

AI Workflow OS **shall not** select, rank, benchmark, or optimize AI models or execution backends.

The OS is prohibited from:

* Comparing model performance
* Choosing preferred models
* Optimizing cost, speed, or quality

Model choice and optimization are execution-side concerns and lie outside governance scope.

---

### 13.4 Prohibition of Autonomous Objective Generation

AI Workflow OS **shall not** generate objectives, intents, or goals autonomously.

The OS is prohibited from:

* Inventing tasks
* Inferring goals
* Proposing direction without externally supplied intent

All intent must originate outside the OS and be explicitly externalized.

---

### 13.5 Prohibition of Implicit Learning or Adaptation

AI Workflow OS **shall not** perform implicit learning or adaptation.

The OS is prohibited from:

* Accumulating behavioral patterns
* Adapting rules automatically
* Modifying governance based on observed outcomes

All evolution requires explicit governance artifacts and authorization.

---

### 13.6 Prohibition of Embedded Intelligence or Reasoning

AI Workflow OS **shall not** reason, infer, or decide.

The OS is prohibited from:

* Interpreting intent
* Resolving ambiguity autonomously
* Making judgments based on heuristics or context

Reasoning belongs to execution systems; authority belongs to governance.

---

### 13.7 Prohibition of Implicit Coordination or Collective Behavior

AI Workflow OS **shall not** coordinate agents or enable collective intelligence.

The OS is prohibited from:

* Synchronizing agent behavior
* Mediating negotiation
* Enabling consensus, voting, or collective decision mechanisms

Any appearance of coordination arises solely through artifact-level arbitration.

---

### 13.8 Prohibition of Hidden State or Side Channels

AI Workflow OS **shall not** maintain hidden state or side channels.

The OS is prohibited from:

* Relying on conversation memory
* Storing implicit context
* Treating execution-side caches as authoritative

All authoritative state must be artifact-derived.

---

### 13.9 Explicit Deferrals as Layering Discipline

The following concerns are **explicitly deferred** to Protocols, Specifications, or Templates and are out of scope for this Blueprint:

* Artifact schemas and templates
* TaskCard and DRS formats
* Execution backend interfaces
* Capability declaration formats
* Audit procedures and evidence requirements
* Migration mechanics and tooling

Deferral enforces layering discipline; it does not imply omission or future inclusion at the Blueprint level.

---

### 13.10 Prohibition of Convenience-Driven Expansion

Convenience, efficiency, or automation pressure **shall not** justify expansion of OS scope.

The OS is prohibited from absorbing responsibilities from execution systems, tools, or humans to reduce coordination cost.

Boundary erosion constitutes governance failure.

---

### 13.11 Non-Goals as Evolution Constraints

Non-goals constrain system evolution.

Any proposed extension must demonstrate:

* Compatibility with all non-goals
* Preservation of governance boundaries
* Absence of authority leakage

Violation of non-goals requires Blueprint-level revision and supersession, not incremental extension.

---

### 13.12 Implications of Non-Goals & Explicit Deferrals

These exclusions ensure that:

* Governance remains minimal and durable
* Execution innovation remains unconstrained
* Authority does not drift into tooling or automation
* The OS remains survivable under change

The system remains strong by **refusing responsibilities it must not hold**.

---

## **14. Evolution, Migration & Version Discipline**

### 14.1 Purpose of Version Discipline

Version discipline exists to **preserve constitutional integrity under change**.

Evolution without discipline erodes authority.
Discipline without evolution causes stagnation.

This chapter defines how AI Workflow OS may evolve **only through explicit constitutional process**.

---

### 14.2 Constitutional Supremacy and Conflict Priority

The active Blueprint is the highest-order authority in AI Workflow OS.

In the event of conflict:

* The Blueprint overrides all Canon, Protocols, Specifications, Templates, and operational artifacts.
* Lower-level artifacts may not reinterpret, bypass, or dilute Blueprint constraints.

Any artifact conflicting with the active Blueprint is invalid by definition.

---

### 14.3 Version Semantics

Blueprint versions carry strict semantic meaning:

* **Major Version**
  Constitutional change. Redefines authority, boundaries, or invariants.

* **Minor Version**
  Additive clarification or extension that preserves all constitutional constraints.

* **Patch Version**
  Non-semantic correction that does not alter meaning, scope, or authority.

Misuse of version semantics constitutes governance failure.

---

### 14.4 Conditions Requiring Major Version Change

A Major version is required if and only if a proposal:

* Alters Core Design Invariants
* Modifies Role Mode definitions or authority hierarchy
* Changes authorization, acceptance, or freeze semantics
* Violates or removes any Non-Goal
* Reassigns governance responsibility across layers

Introducing any such change under a minor or patch version is invalid.

---

### 14.5 Migration as a Governed Constitutional Event

Migration is a **governed constitutional event**, not an operational activity.

Migration must be:

* Explicitly proposed
* Explicitly accepted
* Explicitly recorded

Implicit, partial, or de facto migration is prohibited.

---

### 14.6 Scoped Coexistence During Migration

Multiple Blueprint versions may coexist **only under explicit scope separation**.

Coexistence requires:

* Clear declaration of which artifacts are governed by which Blueprint version
* Explicit prohibition of cross-version authority inheritance
* No implicit authority propagation across versions

Unscoped coexistence constitutes governance failure.

---

### 14.7 Backward Compatibility Is Optional and Explicit

Backward compatibility is **not presumed**.

Compatibility may be preserved only if:

* Explicitly declared
* Fully compatible with all active constraints
* Does not preserve invalid or deprecated behavior

Convenience is not a valid justification for compatibility.

---

### 14.8 Migration Without Reinterpretation

Migration must not require reinterpretation of historical intent or authority.

Artifacts remain authoritative under the Blueprint version in effect at acceptance time.

Migration proceeds by supersession, not revision.

---

### 14.9 Blueprint Freeze and Historical Integrity

Once frozen, a Blueprint version defines immutable constitutional truth.

Frozen versions:

* May not be modified
* May only be superseded by a later accepted version
* Remain authoritative for artifacts bound to them

History is preserved through freeze, not overwrite.

---

### 14.10 Authority to Approve Migration

Authority to accept a Blueprint migration rests exclusively with the Project Owner.

No execution system, protocol, or subordinate artifact may authorize or force migration.

Migration authority is singular and non-delegable.

---

### 14.11 Evolution Constrained by Non-Goals

Non-Goals constrain evolution.

Any evolutionary proposal must demonstrate:

* Compatibility with all Non-Goals
* Preservation of governance boundaries
* Absence of authority leakage

Violation of Non-Goals requires a new Major version.

---

### 14.12 Prohibition of Incremental Constitutional Drift

Incremental constitutional drift is prohibited.

Constitutional change must be:

* Explicit
* Versioned
* Accepted

Silent or accumulative drift constitutes governance failure.

---

### 14.13 Implications of Evolution, Migration & Version Discipline

This discipline ensures that:

* Authority remains stable under change
* History remains legible and immutable
* Evolution is deliberate and reviewable
* Governance does not erode under convenience pressure

The system evolves by **explicit constitutional decision**, not by accumulation.

---

## **15. Canonical Authority of This Document**

### 15.1 Constitutional Status and Final Authority

This document, **AI Workflow OS Blueprint V2**, constitutes the **highest constitutional authority** of the AI Workflow Operating System.

All rules governing authority, legitimacy, boundaries, and continuity derive from this document.
No artifact, process, or practice may supersede, reinterpret, or dilute the constraints defined herein.

Any conflict involving this Blueprint is resolved in favor of this Blueprint, without further appeal.

---

### 15.2 Authority Precedence and Conflict Resolution

Authority precedence within AI Workflow OS is strictly ordered as follows:

1. **Active Blueprint (this document)**
2. **Frozen Canon**
3. **Protocols**
4. **Specifications and Templates**
5. **Operational and Execution Artifacts**

Any artifact, action, or interpretation conflicting with a higher-order authority is invalid by definition.

Conflict resolution is determined by **precedence**, not consensus, practice, or interpretation.

---

### 15.3 Interpretation Authority

Interpretation authority of this Blueprint rests **exclusively and non-transferably** with the **Project Owner**.

Interpretation authority includes:

* Resolving ambiguity
* Adjudicating conflicts not mechanically resolvable by precedence
* Determining applicability in edge cases

Interpretation authority may not be delegated, inferred, replicated, or assumed through practice, committee, or consensus.

No execution system, protocol, or subordinate artifact may claim interpretive authority over this Blueprint.

---

### 15.4 Non-Delegability of Constitutional Authority

Constitutional authority defined by this Blueprint is **non-delegable**.

No role, agent, protocol, committee, or process may inherit or exercise constitutional authority.

Delegation of execution, planning, or review does not imply delegation of constitutional power.

The identity and succession of the Project Owner are defined outside this system.

This Blueprint governs authority and interpretation, not ownership succession.

---

### 15.5 Binding Scope

This Blueprint binds:

* All Canon, Protocols, Specifications, and Templates
* All governance actions and state transitions
* All execution backends, agents, and human participants

Binding scope is independent of tool, model, environment, or execution strategy.

---

### 15.6 Invalidity of Implicit Overrides

Implicit overrides, reinterpretations, or de facto modifications of this Blueprint are prohibited.

Changes in behavior, tooling, or long-standing practice that contradict this Blueprint are invalid, regardless of duration or perceived success.

Constitutional change occurs only through explicit supersession.

---

### 15.7 Conditions for Supersession

This Blueprint may be superseded only by a **new Major Blueprint version** that:

* Explicitly declares supersession of this document
* Is accepted by the Project Owner
* Is frozen as the new constitutional authority
* Preserves historical integrity of all prior versions

No minor, patch, or implicit change may supersede this Blueprint.

---

### 15.8 Preservation of Historical Authority

Upon supersession, this Blueprint remains authoritative for all artifacts and decisions accepted under its governance.

Historical authority is preserved through freeze, not reinterpretation.

Supersession defines future authority; it does not rewrite history.

---

### 15.9 Constitutional Closure

This Blueprint defines the **complete and closed set of constitutional rules** governing AI Workflow OS.

All governance paths terminate within the authority defined by this document.
Any further action must reference, comply with, or explicitly supersede this Blueprint.

No governance action exists outside this closure.

---

### 15.10 Implications of Canonical Authority

This canonical authority ensures that:

* Authority remains singular and legible
* Governance disputes are resolvable without ambiguity
* Evolution proceeds only through explicit constitutional action
* The system remains stable under autonomy, scale, and change

This Blueprint is not guidance.
It is the final arbiter.

---

# **Appendix A — Terminology Glossary (Frozen)**

**Status**: FROZEN (Normative)
**Applies To**: AI Workflow OS Blueprint V2 and all derived Canon / Protocols / Specifications
**Authority Level**: Constitutional (Interpretive)

> This Glossary is **normative**.
> In case of conflict, ambiguity, or interpretive dispute, **this Glossary prevails**.

---

## A.1 Core Governance Concepts

### **Authority**

> The power to define what becomes system truth.

Authority determines which artifacts, decisions, or states are binding within the system.

Authority is:

* Structural
* Explicit
* Binary (present or absent)

Authority does **not** arise from intelligence, capability, productivity, repetition, consensus, or practice.

Authority is **not derivable** from legitimacy or validity.

---

### **Legitimacy**

> Eligibility to receive authority.

Legitimacy determines whether an action or outcome may be considered for acceptance or freeze.

Legitimacy:

* Is necessary but not sufficient for authority
* Does not imply authority

Legitimacy does **not** arise from correctness, usefulness, or execution success.

---

### **Validity**

> Conformance to structural and procedural constraints.

Validity determines whether an action, transition, or artifact complies with Blueprint-defined rules.

Validity:

* Is a prerequisite for legitimacy
* Does not imply legitimacy or authority

An invalid action is ineligible for legitimacy or authority.

---

### **Governance Action**

> Any explicit, authorized act that mutates authority, system state, or governance scope.

Governance Actions include (non-exhaustive):

* Acceptance
* Freeze
* Supersession
* Authorization
* Revocation

Execution activities may propose changes, but **may never constitute Governance Actions**, even if their outputs are later accepted.

---

## A.2 Actors and Execution Concepts

### **Actor**

> Any participant capable of performing actions within the system.

Actors may be:

* Human
* AI-based
* Hybrid

Actor is the most general term.

---

### **Agent**

> An AI-based Actor.

All Agents are Actors.
Not all Actors are Agents.

Agents are subject to the same governance constraints as any Actor.

---

### **Execution System**

> The technical substrate enabling execution by an Actor or Agent.

Execution Systems include AI models, agent frameworks, toolchains, and runtimes.

Execution Systems:

* Are not governance entities
* May not perform Governance Actions
* May not be treated as Actors unless explicitly acting through one

---

### **Execution Backend**

> An external Execution System providing execution capability.

Execution Backends:

* Exist outside the governance boundary
* Produce speculative outputs only
* May not participate in governance, authorization, or interpretation

---

## A.3 Role and Authorization Concepts

### **Role**

> An organizational identity describing responsibility.

Role alone grants no permission, legitimacy, or authority.

---

### **Role Mode**

> A formally authorized execution context that determines which actions are legitimate.

Role Mode:

* Binds permissions and prohibitions to actions
* Is required for any action to be considered valid
* Is evaluated per action, not per actor identity

Role Mode is **not** a persona, prompt, or behavioral style.

---

### **Authorization**

> A Governance Action that assigns, modifies, or revokes a Role Mode.

Authorization is:

* Explicit
* Attributable
* Temporally scoped

Implicit, inferred, or emergent authorization is invalid.

---

## A.4 Artifact and State Concepts

### **Artifact**

> An externalized, durable representation of decisions, rules, or outcomes.

Artifacts are the **only medium** through which authority and system state exist.

What is not externalized as an artifact does not exist within the system.

---

### **Draft Artifact**

> A non-authoritative artifact proposal.

Draft Artifacts:

* Are speculative
* May be created by execution
* Are ineligible for authority until accepted

---

### **Accepted Artifact**

> An artifact explicitly granted legitimacy.

Acceptance does not imply immutability.

---

### **Frozen Artifact**

> An accepted artifact whose authority is fixed in time.

Frozen Artifacts define immutable historical truth.

---

### **System State**

> The minimal sufficient set of authoritative artifacts defining current governance position.

System State:

* Is artifact-derived
* Is fully reconstructable
* May not be inferred, extrapolated, or completed by reasoning

---

## A.5 Workflow Concepts

### **Workflow Spine**

> The canonical legitimacy structure governing all work.

Defined as:

```
Intent → Decision → Artifact → Execution → Validation → State Update
```

Any work not mappable to this structure is invalid.

---

### **Intent**

> A non-authoritative expression of desired change or inquiry.

Intent:

* Creates no obligation
* Grants no permission
* Does not alter state

---

### **Decision**

> A Governance Action converting intent into governed direction.

Only authorized Role Modes may produce Decisions.

---

### **Execution**

> Any activity producing speculative outputs.

Execution:

* Is always non-authoritative
* May be parallel or autonomous
* Cannot perform Governance Actions

---

### **Validation**

> Evaluation of execution outputs for eligibility.

Validation:

* Does not confer authority
* Does not alter state

---

### **State Update**

> A Governance Action that mutates System State.

Occurs only through Acceptance, Freeze, or Supersession.

---

## A.6 Multi-Agent and Capability Concepts

### **Capability**

> An execution-side fact describing what an Actor or Execution Backend can do.

Capability:

* Is descriptive, not normative
* Does not imply permission, legitimacy, or authority
* May be incomplete or unreliable

---

### **Capability Awareness**

> Governance awareness of declared or observed capability.

Capability Awareness:

* Influences constraint application only
* May not initiate execution, orchestration, or decision-making

---

### **Multi-Agent Coexistence**

> Simultaneous presence of multiple Agents within the same governance system.

Coexistence does not imply coordination, consensus, or collective authority.

---

### **Artifact-Level Arbitration**

> Resolution of conflicts exclusively through artifact evaluation.

Agents do not resolve conflicts.
Governance does.

---

## A.7 Temporal and Evolution Concepts

### **Freeze**

> A Governance Action preserving authority across time.

Freeze prevents silent mutation and preserves historical truth.

---

### **Supersession**

> A Governance Action replacing future authority without rewriting history.

Supersession is forward-looking only.

---

### **Migration**

> A governed transition between Blueprint versions.

Migration does not reinterpret history.

---

### **Project Owner**

> The sole holder of constitutional interpretation and migration authority.

Project Owner identity and succession are defined outside the system.

---

## A.8 Prohibited Interpretations (Binding)

The following interpretations are **explicitly invalid**:

* Execution success creates authority
* Capability implies permission or legitimacy
* Validity implies authority
* Consensus implies legitimacy
* Practice overrides constitution
* Intelligence substitutes for governance

---

## A.9 Glossary Authority Clause

This Glossary is **normative and frozen**.

* All terms defined herein have fixed meaning.
* No derived document may redefine these terms.
* Ambiguity must be resolved in favor of this Glossary.

Any conflict between this Glossary and a derived artifact renders the derived artifact invalid.

---
