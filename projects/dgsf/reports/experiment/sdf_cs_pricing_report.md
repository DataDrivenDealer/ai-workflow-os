## Fama-MacBeth Regression Results

### Risk Premium Estimates

| Factor | Lambda (Mean) | Std | t-stat | Sig. (5%) |
|--------|---------------|-----|--------|-----------|
| Intercept | -0.0004 | 0.0071 | -0.60 |  |
| Factor_1 | 0.0114 | 0.0304 | 4.11 | ✓ |
| Factor_2 | 0.0026 | 0.0321 | 0.90 |  |
| Factor_3 | 0.0003 | 0.0349 | 0.10 |  |
| Factor_4 | 0.0025 | 0.0345 | 0.79 |  |
| Factor_5 | -0.0036 | 0.0431 | -0.90 |  |

### Model Fit

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average Cross-sectional R² | 0.5004 |
| Adjusted R² | 0.4437 |
| Average Pricing Error | 0.003694 |
| Periods | 120 |
| Assets | 50 |
| Factors | 5 |

### Interpretation

The Fama-MacBeth regression decomposes expected returns into factor risk premia:

$$E[R_i] = \alpha + \sum_{k=1}^K \beta_{ik} \lambda_k$$

Where $\lambda_k$ is the risk premium for factor $k$.

**Key Findings:**
- 1 of 5 factors have significant risk premia at 5% level
- Cross-sectional R² of 50.0% indicates strong factor model fit



## Feature Importance Analysis

### Top 10 Features (Permutation Importance)

| Rank | Feature | Importance | Cumulative |
|------|---------|------------|------------|
| 1 | value_5 | 0.000107 | 14.3% |
| 2 | momentum_2 | 0.000065 | 23.0% |
| 3 | quality_1 | 0.000062 | 31.3% |
| 4 | volatility_2 | 0.000058 | 39.1% |
| 5 | liquidity_3 | 0.000048 | 45.5% |
| 6 | size_4 | 0.000044 | 51.4% |
| 7 | sentiment_2 | 0.000028 | 55.2% |
| 8 | volatility_4 | 0.000027 | 58.7% |
| 9 | macro_1 | 0.000026 | 62.2% |
| 10 | quality_6 | 0.000026 | 65.7% |

### Feature Categories Distribution

Based on permutation importance, the most impactful feature categories are:
1. Features with highest individual importance indicate direct pricing relevance
2. Cumulative importance shows how quickly pricing power is captured

**Concentration**: Top 5 features explain 45.5% of pricing variation


## Recommendations

### For SDF Model Improvement
1. **Focus on significant factors**: Factors with |t-stat| > 1.96 carry pricing information
2. **Feature selection**: Top features by permutation importance should be retained
3. **Regularization**: Features with low importance may be dropped to reduce overfitting

### For Production Use
1. Re-validate with out-of-sample data
2. Monitor factor premium stability over time
3. Consider regime-dependent factor models
